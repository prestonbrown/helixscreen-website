## Version Scheme

HelixScreen uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]
```

| Component | When to Increment |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes (config format, API, incompatible UI changes) |
| **MINOR** | New features, backwards-compatible |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes, documentation, minor improvements |
| **PRERELEASE** | **Do not use.** See below. |

> ### Never ship a prerelease suffix
>
> `helix::version::Version` **discards** the prerelease suffix when parsing
> (`include/version.h`). `v1.0.0-rc.1`, `v1.0.0-beta` and `v1.0.0` all parse to
> `1.0.0` and compare **equal**.
>
> So a user who installs `v1.0.0-rc.1` has an app that believes it is already on
> `1.0.0`. When the real `1.0.0` publishes, the updater sees no newer version and
> **never offers it**. Your testers are stranded on the release candidate.
>
> Use a plain monotonic version instead, and pick the audience with the branch's
> `RELEASE_CHANNEL` file rather than with the tag string. That is exactly why
> `RELEASE_CHANNEL` exists - read its header comment. A release candidate that
> everyone should test is just the next `PATCH` on the line they are already on
> (v0.99.114 was the 1.0 RC, shipped on the stable 0.99.x line).

### Examples

- `v1.0.0` - First stable release
- `v1.1.0` - New features added
- `v1.1.1` - Bug fix
- `v2.0.0` - Breaking changes
- `v0.99.114` - a release candidate: a plain PATCH bump, audience chosen by
  `RELEASE_CHANNEL`, **not** by a `-rc` suffix

---

## Automated Release Pipeline

The release process is fully automated via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

### Trigger

Pushing a tag matching `v*` triggers the release workflow:

```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

### Pipeline Stages

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Tag Push (v1.2.0)                       │
└──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                               │

  validate-shell gate → build-platforms matrix (9):
    pi · pi32 · ad5m · cc1 · k1 · ad5x · k2 · x86 · snapmaker-u1
  plus build-android → publish-android
    `release` needs build-android too, not just build-platforms — otherwise it
    could publish before Android finished and ship with no APKs, silently.
    build-android FAILS the whole release if ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 is unset;
    it no longer falls back to the debug keystore. See ANDROID_PLAY_STORE.md.

  Each platform job: Docker cross-toolchain → target arch → package .zip

> **Bridge release note:** Starting with v1.0.0 (the version you're currently preparing), the primary release asset is `helixscreen-{platform}.zip` (unversioned filename). The legacy `helixscreen-{platform}-v{version}.tar.gz` is still published during this bridge release for backwards compatibility with older installed versions; it will be removed in the following release.

## Creating a Release

### Step 1: Prepare the Release

1. **Ensure main branch is stable:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   make test-run  # Run tests
   ```

2. **Bump `VERSION.txt` and add the CHANGELOG entry, in one `chore(release):` commit.**
   `VERSION.txt` is the source of truth for the built binary (`Makefile:195`,
   `mk/cross.mk`) - the version does **not** come from the git tag. Tagging
   without bumping the file ships a binary that reports the previous version.
   - `echo "X.Y.Z" > VERSION.txt`
   - Add the release section to `CHANGELOG.md` above the previous one
   - `git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z" CHANGELOG.md VERSION.txt`
   - Also check `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` for any hardcoded version strings

3. **Test on actual hardware:**
   - MainsailOS / Raspberry Pi
   - AD5M with ForgeX (if applicable)
   - Run through verification checklist in `docs/user/TESTING_INSTALLATION.md`

### Step 2: Create the Tag

**With release notes (recommended):**

```bash
# Create annotated tag with release notes
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's New

### Features
- Added input shaper visualization
- Improved AMS panel responsiveness

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed crash when Moonraker disconnects during print
- Fixed touch calibration on rotated displays

### Other
- Updated documentation
- Performance improvements
EOF
)"

# Push the tag
git push origin v1.2.0
```

**Without release notes:**

```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

The workflow auto-generates basic release notes if no annotation is provided.

### Step 3: Monitor the Build

1. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. Watch the "Release" workflow
3. Build takes ~15-20 minutes typically

### Step 4: Verify the Release

1. Go to **Releases** on GitHub
2. Check both platform archives are attached
3. Verify checksums in release notes
4. Test installation:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
   ```

- [ ] All tests pass (`make test-run`)
- [ ] No critical bugs in issue tracker
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] Tested on real hardware (Pi and/or AD5M)

### After Release

- [ ] Release workflow completed successfully
- [ ] Both platform artifacts attached
- [ ] Release notes accurate
- [ ] Installation tested via curl|sh
- [ ] Update any external references (Discord, documentation sites)

---

## Hotfix Releases

For urgent bug fixes:

1. **Create hotfix branch** from the release tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1 v1.2.0
   ```

2. **Apply minimal fix** - only the necessary changes

3. **Test thoroughly** - verify the fix, check for regressions

4. **Merge to main** (via PR if time permits):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/v1.2.1
   ```

5. **Tag and release:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Fix: [description of fix]"
   git push origin v1.2.1
   ```

---

## Pre-release Versions

For testing new features before stable release:

### Creating a Pre-release

```bash
# Beta version
git tag -a v1.3.0-beta -m "Beta release for testing new AMS features"
git push origin v1.3.0-beta

# Release candidate
git tag -a v1.3.0-rc.1 -m "Release candidate 1"
git push origin v1.3.0-rc.1
```

### Pre-release Behavior

The GitHub prerelease flag and the R2 upload channels both come from the
**`RELEASE_CHANNEL` file at the repo root**, on the branch being tagged — not from
the tag string. See `docs/devel/UPDATE_SYSTEM.md` § "How CI Determines Upload
Channels" for the full table and the reason.

- `RELEASE_CHANNEL=stable` -> full GitHub release, shown as "latest"
- `RELEASE_CHANNEL=beta` or `dev` -> marked **prerelease**, not shown as "latest"
- Users must explicitly choose to install a prerelease:
  ```bash
  curl -sSL .../install.sh | sh -s -- --version v1.3.0-beta
  ```

**Do not use a `-suffix` to mean "devel build".** `helix::version::Version`
discards prerelease suffixes, so `v1.1.0-dev1` and `v1.1.0-dev2` compare equal and
the in-app updater stops offering builds. Devel-track releases use plain
incrementing versions and rely on `RELEASE_CHANNEL` for routing. A suffixed tag on
a `stable` branch is rejected by `scripts/release-channel.sh`.

### Graduating Pre-releases

After testing:

```bash
# When beta is ready for stable
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Stable release"
git push origin v1.3.0
```

---

## Manual Release (Emergency)

If GitHub Actions fails, you can build and release manually:

### Build Locally

```bash
# Build for Pi
make PLATFORM_TARGET=pi clean release-pi

# Build for AD5M
make PLATFORM_TARGET=ad5m clean release-ad5m
```

### Create Release Manually

1. Go to GitHub **Releases** → **Draft a new release**
2. Choose the tag
3. Write release notes
4. Upload the `.zip` files from `releases/` (plus the legacy `.tar.gz` files if the bridge release still ships them)
5. Publish

---

## Changelog Generation

`CHANGELOG.md` is the changelog. It is written by hand in the release commit (Step 1);
nothing generates it. The annotated tag's message becomes the GitHub release body
(Step 2), and `scripts/generate-whatsnew.sh` distills the finished CHANGELOG section
into the Play Store "What's New" - both consume what was already written.

Prose style - user-facing voice, separator, issue-link form, and the daily vs milestone
entry shapes - is specified in [CHANGELOG_STYLE.md](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/blob/main/docs/devel/CHANGELOG_STYLE.md). Read it before
drafting the release's section.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

1. Check Actions logs for the specific error
2. Common issues:
   - Submodule not checked out
   - Docker cache issues (try re-running)
   - Toolchain image problems

### Wrong Version Released

1. **Delete the release** on GitHub
2. **Delete the tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag -d v1.2.0
   git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.0
   ```
3. Fix the issue
4. Re-tag and push

### Missing Artifact

If one platform's build fails:

1. Fix the issue
2. Delete the partial release
3. Delete and re-push the tag to trigger fresh build
