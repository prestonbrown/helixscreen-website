## Bed Mesh

![Bed Mesh Panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/controls-bed-mesh.png)

The Bed Mesh panel has two parts: a 3D visualization of your bed surface on the left, and information cards on the right.

**Visualization (left):**

- **Color gradient**: Blue (low) to Red (high)
- **Touch to rotate** the 3D view
- **Pinch** to zoom in on the spot, **two-finger drag** to move a zoomed view around; pinching all the way out returns to the full view
- When no mesh is loaded, the panel shows a "No mesh loaded" placeholder

**Current Mesh card (right):** shows the active profile name, mesh size (probe-point grid), highest and lowest points, and the overall Z range (variance).

**Probe a new mesh:** tap **Probe** in the panel header. HelixScreen first asks which profile to store the new mesh in. The name starts as `default`, the profile Klipper loads at startup; type another name to keep the new mesh separate. Tap **Start** to probe. When probing finishes, HelixScreen asks whether to save the printer configuration so the mesh survives a restart.

The visualization mode (3D, 2D, or Auto) can be changed in **Settings > Appearance > Bed Mesh Render**.

### Profile Management

The **Profiles** card on the right lists your saved mesh profiles. Each row shows the profile name and its Z range, with action icons on the right:

| Icon | Appears on | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Load** (up arrow) | Inactive profiles | Loads that saved mesh, making it the active profile |
| **Rename** (pencil) | The active profile | Opens the rename dialog (see below) |
| **Delete** (trash) | Every profile | Removes that saved profile |

Tapping a row (or its Load icon) loads that profile.

**Renaming a profile:**

1. Tap the **pencil** icon on the active profile
2. The rename dialog shows the current name and a field for the new name
3. Enter a new profile name and tap **Rename**. Klipper reserves `default` for new calibrations, so a profile cannot be renamed to it.

**After renaming or deleting**, HelixScreen asks **"Save changes to persist them across restarts?"** Profile changes only live in memory until saved:

- Tap **Save** to write the change to your printer's saved configuration. This persists the change across restarts but **restarts Klipper**.
- Tap **Don't Save** to keep the change for the current session only — it will be lost when the printer reboots.

## Screws Tilt Adjust

![Screws Tilt Panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-screws.png)

Assisted manual bed leveling:

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Screws Tilt**
2. Tap **Measure** to probe all bed screw positions
3. View adjustment amounts (e.g., "CW 00:15" = clockwise 15 minutes)
4. Adjust screws and re-measure until level

**Color coding:**

- **Green**: Level (within tolerance)
- **Yellow**: Minor adjustment needed
- **Red**: Significant adjustment needed

### Sharing the Results

Next to **Done** and **Re-probe** in the results view, a **share button** (QR icon) opens a card with every screw's name, probed height, and adjustment spelled out, plus a QR code alongside. The QR encodes exactly the same results as plain text — scan it with any phone camera and the numbers appear there, ready to paste into your notes or a forum post. A printer has no clipboard to copy from, so the QR is how the values leave the screen.

The reference screw is labeled **base** (it is the one everything else is measured against), and a screw needing no adjustment shows `--`.

## Input Shaper

![Input Shaper Panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-shaper.png)

Tune vibration compensation for smoother, faster prints:

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Input Shaper**
2. Review your current shaper configuration displayed at the top
3. Pre-flight check verifies accelerometer is connected
4. Select axis to test (X or Y)
5. Tap **Calibrate** to run the resonance test. While the printer sweeps, a progress bar fills from 0 to 100%; the sweep covers the frequency range your printer's own resonance-tester config specifies, so progress tracks the real sweep rather than a fixed span. Once the sweep finishes it is replaced by a spinner with an "Analyzing data... Ns" counter while the printer's host crunches the samples. On slower printers the analysis alone can take a few minutes per axis; that wait is why the whole run gets a 10-minute timeout
6. View the **frequency response chart**; tap a shaper's chip to select it - the chart highlights what that shaper would leave behind
7. Review the **comparison table** showing recommended shaper and alternatives (frequency, vibration reduction, smoothing)
8. Check the **change summary** under the table: it shows what was active before the run ("ei @ 69.8 Hz -> mzv @ 53.8 Hz") and, when the chart has data, how much vibration the old setting would leave on today's measurements versus the new one ("Old setting on today's data: 8.4% residual - now: 7.8%")
9. Tap **Save**. One button does both jobs: it writes your selected shaper for each axis to the Klipper config and restarts the printer's firmware, so the new setting is active immediately and persists across reboots.

![Mid-sweep: the progress bar fills as frequencies are tested (step 5)](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-shaper-sweep.png)
![After the sweep: the spinner counts analysis seconds (step 5)](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-shaper-analysis.png)
![The change summary under the comparison table (step 8)](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-shaper-delta.png)

**Chart features:**
- The chart plots **relative vibration** (see the caption above each chart): lower is less residual vibration
- The legend keys all three curve kinds: **Measured (shaper off)** is the raw vibration your printer produced during the test, the shaper chips show the vibration each shaper would leave behind, and **Previous** shows what your old setting would have left behind (only shown when a previous setting existed)
- The shaper chips act as a selector, not a stack of switches: one shaper per axis is selected, the selected chip is what **Save** writes, and tapping the selected chip again keeps it selected
- Platform-adaptive: full interactive charts on desktop, simplified on embedded hardware
- Per-axis results shown independently

> **Creality K1/K2 note:** some Creality firmware versions overwrite the saved X-axis result with the Y-axis values when you calibrate both axes. HelixScreen detects this and shows a warning on the X results card — the X values it measured were correct, but the printer's saved config discards them. (On a Y-only run the warning appears on the Y card instead, since there is no X card to carry it.) Re-run **Calibrate X** alone and save if you want the measured X values kept.

![Input Shaper Results](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-shaper-results.png)

> **Requirement:** Accelerometer must be configured in Klipper for measurements. If no accelerometer is detected, the pre-flight check will show a warning.

## Probe Management

View and control your Z probe from **Advanced > Probe Management**. HelixScreen auto-detects your probe type and shows the appropriate controls.

**Supported probe types:**

| Probe | Detected As | Type-Specific Controls |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Cartographer** | Cartographer | Calibrate, Touch Cal, Scan Cal |
| **Beacon** | Beacon | Calibrate, Auto-Calibrate |
| **BTT Eddy / Mellow Fly Eddy** | Eddy Current | Calibrate, Drive Current Cal |
| **BLTouch** | BLTouch | Deploy, Stow, Reset, Self-Test |
| **Voron Tap** | Voron Tap | — |
| **Klicky** | Klicky | Deploy, Dock |
| **Standard probe** | Probe | — |

**Universal actions** (all probe types):

| Button | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Accuracy Test** | Runs `PROBE_ACCURACY` to check probe repeatability |
| **Z-Offset Cal** | Opens the interactive Z-offset calibration panel |
| **Bed Mesh** | Opens the bed mesh calibration panel |

**Configuration:** Tap any config row (X/Y offset, samples, speed, retract distance, tolerance) to edit probe settings directly — changes are saved to your Klipper config with a firmware restart.

## Z-Offset Calibration

![Z-Offset Panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-zoffset.png)

Interactive panel for dialing in your Z-offset when not printing. Works with all probe types — Cartographer, Beacon, BLTouch, eddy current probes, and standard probes.

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Z-Offset**, or tap **Z-Offset Cal** in the Probe Management overlay
2. Optionally enable **Warm Bed** to heat the bed before calibrating (accounts for thermal expansion)
3. Tap **Start** — the printer homes and begins the calibration sequence
4. Use the **+/−** adjustment buttons to lower the nozzle (paper test: adjust until paper drags slightly)
5. Tap **Accept** when satisfied, or **Abort** to cancel
6. The offset is saved to your Klipper config automatically

HelixScreen picks the right calibration command for your setup (`PROBE_CALIBRATE`, `Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE`, or `SET_GCODE_OFFSET`) based on your printer's detected probe configuration.

> **Quick access:** A **Z Calibration** button is also available on the Controls panel for one-tap access.

> **Tool changer?** Some printers can also measure Z automatically for every tool, including the reference one, as part of [automatic Tool Offsets calibration](#tool-offsets-beta) — on those, this paper-test flow is hidden. Most tool changers only measure the *other* tools' offsets relative to the reference tool, so the paper test stays available to set the reference tool's own Z.

---

## Tool Offsets *(Beta)*

![Tool Offsets Panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-tool-offsets.png)

For tool-changer printers that can measure their own tool positions: one tap calibrates every tool's X, Y, and Z offset in a single automated pass, instead of adjusting each tool by hand.

### Requirements

This screen only appears on a tool changer whose firmware exposes the calibration macro. If your printer doesn't have it, use the regular [Z-Offset Calibration](#z-offset-calibration) flow instead — it still works per-tool.

Every tool your printer reports gets its own row, however many there are:

![Tool Offsets Panel with many tools](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-tool-offsets-many-tools.png)

A tool that has never been calibrated shows `--` on each axis instead of a number, so it's never mistaken for a tool that measured exactly zero.

### Running a Calibration

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Tool Offsets** —

   ![Tool Offsets row in the Advanced panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-beta-tool-offsets-row.png)

   — or tap **Tool Offsets** on the Controls panel:

   ![Tool Offsets button on the Controls panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/controls-tool-offsets.png)

2. Clean every nozzle first — the confirmation dialog reminds you:

   ![Tool Offsets confirmation dialog](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-tool-offsets-confirm.png)

3. Tap **Calibrate all tools**, then confirm. The printer measures each tool in turn against its sensor; the row for whichever tool is currently being probed gets a highlighted border so it's clear which one is changing, while the rest keep showing their last known values

![Tool Offsets Panel while running](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-tool-offsets-running.png)

4. When the status line reads **Calibration complete**, tap **Save offsets** to write the results to your Klipper config (this briefly restarts Klipper, same as any other offset save)

![Tool Offsets Panel after a completed run](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/advanced-tool-offsets-complete.png)

5. If the run fails partway through, the status line explains why and the run stops there — clean the affected tool's nozzle and try again

Tapping **Stop** during a run performs an emergency stop, since the calibration macro can't be paused partway through — only cancelled outright.

## Belt Tension

Belt Tension is not available yet. The pluck tuner that was in the 1.1 beta gave readings too
inconsistent to adjust a belt by on real printers, so it has been withdrawn. Its replacement
drives each belt path with the motors using Klipper's `TEST_RESONANCES` and compares the two
responses, which gives the same excitation every run. Progress is tracked in
[#1721](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/issues/1721).

## Pressure Advance

Some printers can measure pressure advance themselves instead of printing a tuning tower you judge by eye. On those, a **Pressure Adv.** button appears in the Controls panel's **Calibration & Tools** card, and a **Pressure Advance** row under **Advanced > Calibration**. Today that is the **Snapmaker U1** and the **FlashForge Creator 5 Pro**; on other printers both stay hidden.

1. Tap either entry and pick the tool to measure. Picking a tool mounts it.
2. Set the nozzle temperature for the filament that's loaded, or tap a material preset.
3. Tap **Start** and confirm. Filament must be loaded: the printer heats the nozzle and extrudes a series of short test moves, which takes a few minutes (about 3 on the U1, up to 5 on the Creator 5 Pro).
4. Read the result. A value outside the usual range for the extruder is flagged so you can measure again.

Where the result goes depends on the printer:

- **Snapmaker U1:** the printer applies the value and keeps it for that tool.
- **Creator 5 Pro:** the printer keeps nothing. Copy the value into the filament's slicer profile.

Leaving the screen while it is still heating stops the run. Once measuring has started, **Stop** ends the run on the screen, but the printer finishes that measurement on its own and the nozzle stays hot.

## Heater Calibration (PID / MPC)

![Heater Calibration Panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/controls-pid.png)

Calibrate temperature controllers for stable heating. HelixScreen supports two calibration methods:

- **PID** — Classic proportional-integral-derivative tuning. Works on all Klipper firmware.
- **MPC** *(Beta)* — Model Predictive Control. A physics-based thermal model that can provide more stable temperatures. Requires [Kalico](https://github.com/KalicoCrew/kalico) firmware (a Klipper fork with MPC support).

### PID Calibration

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Heater Calibration**
2. Select **Nozzle** or **Bed**
3. Choose a **material preset** (PLA, PETG, ABS, etc.) or enter a custom target temperature
4. Optionally set **fan speed** — calibrating with the fan on gives more accurate results for printing conditions
5. Tap **Start** to begin automatic tuning

**During calibration:**
- **Live temperature graph** shows the heater cycling in real-time
- **Progress percentage** updates as calibration proceeds
- **Abort button** available if you need to stop early
- A **20-minute timeout** acts as a safety net for stuck calibrations (slow-cooling beds can legitimately take longer than 15 minutes, so the limit sits above that)

**When complete:**
- View new PID values (Kp, Ki, Kd) with **old-to-new deltas** so you can see what changed
- Tap **Save Config** to persist the new values to your Klipper configuration

> **Tip:** Run PID tuning after any hardware change (new heater, thermistor, or hotend) and with the fan speed you typically use while printing.

### MPC Calibration (Beta — Kalico Only)

If you are running Kalico firmware and have [beta features enabled](/1.1/guide/beta-features/), a **Method** selector appears with MPC and PID options. HelixScreen auto-detects Kalico — the selector only appears when it is detected.

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Heater Calibration**
2. Select **MPC** in the Method selector (marked with a BETA badge)
3. Select **Nozzle** or **Bed**
4. Choose a target temperature preset
5. For nozzle calibration, select a **fan calibration level**: Quick (3 points), Detailed (5 points), or Thorough (7 points) — more points improve accuracy but take longer
6. If switching from PID to MPC for the first time, enter your **heater wattage** (check your heater's rating — typically 40–60W for hotends)
7. Tap **Start**

**First-time MPC switch:** If your heater is currently configured for PID, HelixScreen will automatically update your Klipper configuration to MPC mode and restart Klipper before beginning calibration. A progress screen shows "Updating Configuration..." during this step.

**When complete:**
- View MPC model parameters: Heat Capacity, Sensor Response, Ambient Transfer, and Fan Transfer (nozzle only)
- Results are automatically saved to your Klipper configuration
