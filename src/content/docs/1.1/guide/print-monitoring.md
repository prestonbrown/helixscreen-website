HelixScreen watches over a print in two ways: it runs a series of filament checks *before* a job starts (an empty required slot stops with **Check filament**; unassigned tools, a grade or material change, stray filament in the toolhead, and a too-light spool each raise their own warning below), and — on printers that support it — it reacts when the printer's own camera spots a print going wrong. This page covers both.

## Pre-Print Filament Check

When you start a multi-color or multi-tool print, HelixScreen compares what the sliced file expects in each tool against what's actually loaded in your filament system. If a required tool points at an **empty slot**, HelixScreen stops and shows a **Check filament** dialog before anything heats up or moves — so you don't discover the problem halfway through a long print.

This check runs automatically. You don't turn it on; it's part of starting any print on a system with a multi-slot filament backend (AMS, CFS, IFS, Box Turtle, Happy Hare, etc.). On a single-extruder printer with no such system, there are no slots to compare against, so this dialog never appears — filament presence there is handled by your runout sensor instead.

**Printing from bypass is the other exception.** When bypass is engaged, filament goes straight to the extruder without passing through any slot, so there is no slot for the check to look at and every tool would read as unfed. Rather than warn about all of them, HelixScreen skips the slot checks for as long as bypass stays engaged — and tells you so: the file details show a **Bypass active** note (and, for a single-tool file, hide the filament mapping card entirely — the lanes aren't feeding this print, so there is nothing to assign), and if the material you set on the external spool doesn't match what the file was sliced for (for example, the file says ASA but the spool holds PLA), you get one **Material Mismatch** warning naming the spool. A same-material *grade* difference there — file sliced ASA-GF, spool holding plain ASA — raises the [Filament Grade Mismatch](#the-filament-grade-mismatch-dialog) warning below instead. Tap **Start Anyway** to print regardless. Disengage bypass and the slot checks come back on the next print — you don't have to restart anything.

### What the check looks at

For every tool the file uses (T0, T1, T2, …), HelixScreen compares the slot mapped to that tool against the slicer's intent:

| Result | What it means | Row glyph |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Match** | The mapped slot has filament, and its material and color line up with the file | Green check (✓) |
| **Color differs** | Right material, but the loaded color doesn't match the file's color | Amber warning (⚠) |
| **Material differs** | The loaded material doesn't match what the tool needs | Amber warning (⚠) |
| **Empty slot** | The tool maps to a slot with no filament in it | Red cross (✗) |

### The Check filament dialog

![Check filament dialog](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/preflight-check.png)

The dialog appears when at least one required tool maps to an empty slot **and** you are not printing from bypass — an empty slot is the one condition serious enough to stop a print. When it opens, you see one row per tool:

- A **`Tx`** label (the tool number)
- The **slicer's intended color** as a swatch
- An **arrow**
- The **actually-loaded color** as a swatch, or an **`EMPTY`** label if that slot has no filament
- A **severity glyph** (✓ / ⚠ / ✗) on the right

Below the rows, a short explanation calls out the first blocking problem, for example:

> *T1 needs filament in slot 2, which is empty — this print will run out.*

**Buttons:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Remap…** | Opens the tool-to-slot mapping so you can point the tool at a slot that has filament. Only shown when your filament system supports remapping — it's hidden on ACE and single-extruder (no-AMS) systems. |
| **Cancel** | Backs out without printing. Load or map the missing filament, then start again. |
| **Print Anyway** | Starts the print despite the warning. Use this only if you know the check is wrong (for example, filament is physically loaded but not yet detected). |

> **Note:** An empty slot is the only thing that raises this dialog. A **material or color mismatch does not stop the print** — those are advisory. They show up as a warning icon on the filament mapping card when you pick the file (see [Tool Mapping](filament.md#tool-mapping)), and if the dialog is already open for an empty slot, mismatched tools show an amber warning glyph on their row too.

> **Tip:** If you meant to load that filament, tap **Cancel**, sort out the slot from the [AMS panel](filament.md#ams--multi-material-systems), and start the print again — the check re-runs each time. It also re-runs the moment your filament system's state changes, so loading a slot (or engaging bypass) while the file is still open clears the warning without reopening it.

### The Color Mismatch dialog

![Color Mismatch dialog](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/color-mismatch.png)

There's a second, separate dialog you may see right after the first one clears. Where **Check filament** is about a tool pointing at a slot that's *empty*, **Color Mismatch** is about a tool that doesn't point at a slot **at all** — the file asks for a tool your filament system has no lane assigned to. That happens most often when a file was sliced for more tools than your system has, or when automatic matching couldn't find a home for one of them.

It lists each unmatched tool with the color and material the file wants:

> *T2: Medium Vibrant Orange (PETG)*

**Buttons:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Cancel** | Backs out without printing. Assign the tool from [Tool Mapping](filament.md#tool-mapping), then start again. |
| **Start Anyway** | Starts the print regardless. Your printer's firmware decides what to do when it reaches that tool. |

The name is a little misleading — despite "Color Mismatch", a merely *wrong* color never raises it. It only appears when a tool has no matching filament at all.

Like the empty-slot check, this one is skipped while you're printing from bypass — for a single-tool file, which is the normal bypass case. A multi-tool file with bypass engaged gets its own warning instead: the printer may refuse to load a lane while bypass filament is in the toolhead.

### The Filament Grade Mismatch dialog

Some filaments are the same plastic with something mixed into it. **PLA-CF** is PLA with chopped carbon fibre; **ASA-GF** is ASA with glass fibre; wood, marble, metal and glow-in-the-dark filaments carry a powder. Those all print differently from the plain version — slower, because the filler thickens the melt, and they grind away at a brass nozzle, which is why they normally want a hardened one. A slicer profile for a filled filament is not the profile for its plain counterpart.

Marketing suffixes are the opposite case. **PLA+**, **ABS+** and the like are the same plastic with a toughener, printed on the same hardware with much the same settings, and **Silk** and **Matte** are finishes rather than fillers.

So when the loaded filament is the same material as the file wants but a different *grade*, HelixScreen shows **Filament Grade Mismatch** rather than the Material Mismatch dialog — the polymer is right, so calling it a material mismatch would be misleading, but the difference is still worth a look. It is a warning, never a block, and **PLA vs PLA+** raises nothing at all.

The wording depends on which way round it is, because the risk isn't symmetric:

| Situation | What you're told |
|-----------|------------------|
| The **loaded** spool is the filled one (file wants PLA, lane holds PLA-CF) | That filled filament runs at a lower flow rate and needs a hardened nozzle — this is the direction that can wear out a brass nozzle |
| The **file** is the filled one (file wants PLA-CF, lane holds PLA) | That it will print slower and hotter than the loaded spool needs — a waste of time, not a hardware risk |

**Buttons:** **Start Anyway** prints as-is; **Cancel** backs out so you can load the right spool.

Your tool mapping is unaffected either way. HelixScreen still routes the tool to that lane, exactly as it did before — the grade difference changes what you're told, not where the filament comes from.

### The Filament In The Toolhead dialog

The dialogs above compare what the *file* needs against what your slots hold. This one looks at the toolhead itself: filament is sitting in it, but no lane in your filament system reports having loaded it. That usually means leftovers — filament that was on its way in or out when an earlier job was cancelled or aborted, and never got seated in a lane. Rather than silently print on top of unknown material, HelixScreen asks first:

> *The toolhead has filament but no AMS lane reports it loaded. Pull it out manually before printing. Start anyway?*

**Buttons:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Start Anyway** | Starts the print with the stray filament left in the toolhead. Reasonable when you know what it is and it matches the file — the tail of the spool you just printed with, for example. |
| **Cancel** | Backs out. Tap **Unload** in the filament sidebar, pull the filament out by hand, or load it properly from a lane, then start the print again. |

![The Filament In The Toolhead dialog](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-unaccounted-dialog.png)

Only filament systems that can actually tell raise this dialog — AFC (Box Turtle), Happy Hare, Creality CFS, and FlashForge AD5X IFS. On a system that can't determine it, the dialog never appears, and printing from bypass skips it too: bypass means the toolhead filament is the external spool's, which is exactly what you intended.

### The Not Enough Filament dialog

This one is about quantity, not identity: when you print from the **external spool** and HelixScreen knows how much filament is left on it — a spool tracked through Spoolman with its remaining weight recorded — it compares that against what the file is expected to use before starting:

> *This print needs about 108g but the spool has about 62g remaining. Start anyway?*

**Buttons:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Start Anyway** | Starts the print. Often reasonable: the estimate comes from the slicer's numbers, and spools frequently hold a little more than their label says — a small shortfall may still fit. |
| **Cancel** | Backs out. Swap in a fuller spool (or a fresh one) and start again. |

The estimate uses the file's own filament weight when the slicer recorded it; when it only recorded a length, HelixScreen converts it using the material set on the spool. Two honest silences: spools whose remaining weight is unknown are never compared (there is nothing to compare against), and spools sitting in AMS slots are not covered by this dialog — slot-level tracking belongs to your filament system.

## File Will Stop the Printer

Some printers have macros that double as emergency stops (a `HALT`, a vendor stop command), and a file sliced for a different printer profile can call one by name. HelixScreen scans the start of every file before it can start, looking for commands this printer treats as an emergency stop. When it finds one, starting that file is blocked outright:

> *Line 4123 calls HALT, which this printer treats as an emergency stop. Re-slice the file with a profile made for this printer.*

The dialog names the line and the command, plus the printer's own stop message when it has one. The same check runs when you start a job from the print queue (queue entries usually arrive from a slicer or web UI, so nothing else has looked at them): tap a queued job whose file fails it and the same dialog appears, with the job **left in the queue** so you can fix or remove it.

## Filament Runout During a Print

When the runout sensor stops detecting filament during a print, **the printer's own firmware pauses the job** - that happens before HelixScreen is involved at all. HelixScreen notices the pause and shows the **Filament Runout** modal so you can recover without dropping to the console.

![Filament runout modal](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/runout-modal.png)

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Load** | Runs your load sequence (heat → feed → purge) to bring fresh filament to the nozzle. On an AMS system this loads from the active slot. |
| **Unload** | Retracts the remaining filament so you can swap the spool before loading. |
| **Purge** | Extrudes a little filament to clear the old color or confirm flow. |
| **Close** | Dismisses the modal — resume the print from the status screen once filament is loaded. |

This modal is what handles the recovery on tool-changer and single-extruder printers, on any multi-filament system running from an external spool (bypass), and on the Anycubic ACE and QIDI Box - those two report nothing of their own when filament runs out. Bypass prints get extra protection automatically: when you engage bypass, HelixScreen switches on the toolhead runout sensor at the printer if the filament system's own software had left it off, and switches it back when you disengage.

Systems that *do* raise their own runout alert show that alert instead, so one runout never produces two dialogs. What actually happens next differs by system:

- **AFC (Box Turtle) and Happy Hare** can switch to a backup slot, if you configured one and it holds compatible filament. Otherwise their alert offers the recovery buttons.
- **Creality CFS** always pauses the print first. The box only swaps spools when auto-refill is switched on *and* another slot holds the exact same material **and** colour. If either condition is missing it says so and the print simply stays paused until you load filament and resume.
- **FlashForge AD5X IFS** does not switch spools at all on stock firmware. Its alert tells you filament ran out and offers Resume, Purge, and an IFS reset.

## Print-Failure Detection

Some printers can watch a print through their camera and flag spaghetti: a print that has come loose and turned into a tangle. HelixScreen supports this on two printers:

- **Snapmaker U1** (stock firmware): the printer's own defect detector flags the failure and pauses the print itself.
- **Creality K2 family** (stock firmware, which ships Creality's AI model): HelixScreen runs the printer's own AI model on a camera snapshot every 25 seconds while a print is running, using the interval and sensitivity from the printer's AI settings.

On other printers the detection settings stay hidden.

### Settings

Under **Settings > Safety & Alerts**:

- **Spaghetti Detection** switches detection on or off. It's on by default. On a K2, the first time HelixScreen runs it copies the printer's own AI detection setting, so detection stays off if you had it off in Creality's settings. After that, HelixScreen's switch is the one that counts.
- **Pause on Detection** decides whether a detection pauses the print or only warns you. It's hidden on the U1, which always pauses by itself.

### What happens on a detection

- **Pause on Detection on**, or a printer that paused by itself: the print is paused and a **Print issue detected** dialog explains what was seen, with the detection's confidence where the printer reports one.
- **Pause on Detection off**: a warning toast appears and the print keeps going.

The dialog offers:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Resume** | Continues the paused print. |
| **Abort** | Cancels the print. |
| **Reduce Sensitivity** | (U1 only) Tells the printer to be less quick to flag issues, and leaves the dialog open so you can then Resume or Abort. |
| **Turn off detection** | Switches detection off, and leaves the dialog open for your Resume or Abort choice. |

> **Note:** On the U1, only spaghetti-type failures raise this dialog. Its other defect codes (dirty bed, residue, dirty nozzle) are recognized internally but not surfaced.

> **Note:** The dialog shows a text description of the detected issue, not a camera still.
