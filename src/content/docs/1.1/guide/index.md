Your printer's touchscreen should show you more than temperatures and a progress bar. HelixScreen is a full-featured touch interface for Klipper printers that puts everything at your fingertips — things you'd normally need to open Mainsail or Fluidd for.

**What you get that other touchscreen UIs don't:**

- **A real dashboard** — Drag-and-drop widgets across multiple pages. Temperature graphs, fan controls, camera feeds, power toggles, favorite macros. You decide what's on screen, not the developer.
- **3D visualization** — Rotate your bed mesh with your finger. Preview G-code layers before printing. See input shaper frequency response charts right on the screen.
- **Multi-material that works** — AFC, Happy Hare, ACE, CFS, AD5X IFS, Snapmaker U1, tool changers. Seven backends, tested on real hardware. Per-box drying controls and humidity monitoring, Spoolman integration.
- **Exclude objects** — Tap the failing part on an overhead map to exclude it mid-print. No more scrapping an entire plate for one bad object.
- **Runs on hardware you already own** — ~15MB RAM on embedded targets (a few times more on 64-bit Pi, still well under what other touchscreen UIs need). No X11, no browser, no desktop environment. Directly on the framebuffer. From a Creality K1 to a Pi Zero 2 W to a random mini-ITX box with an HDMI touchscreen.
- **Looks good** — 17 theme presets with a live editor, responsive layouts from 480x320 to 1024x600, GPU-accelerated blur. Light and dark modes. (Ultrawide and portrait screens are alpha — see [Which displays are supported?](FAQ.md#which-displays-are-supported).)
- **Smart setup** — A first-run wizard auto-detects your printer from a database of 90+ models and configures everything. 9 languages.

## Guide Contents

### [Getting Started](/1.1/guide/getting-started/)
Navigation basics, touch gestures, connection status, first-time setup wizard, WiFi configuration, and keyboard input.

![Setup Wizard](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/wizard-wifi.png)

### [Supported Printers](/1.1/guide/supported-printers/)
Which printers get deep, model-specific integration — and exactly what works on each. Covers the FlashForge Adventurer 5M/5X (IFS), Creality K1/K2 (CFS), QIDI Box, Snapmaker U1, Anycubic ACE, and how every other Klipper printer is auto-detected.

### [Home Panel](/1.1/guide/home-panel/)
Your printer dashboard: status area, configurable home widgets (temperature, network, LED, AMS, power, notifications, and more), active tool badge for toolchanger printers, emergency stop, and the Printer Manager with custom images. Long-press the widget grid to enter Edit Mode, where you can add, move, resize, and configure widgets across up to 8 pages; the Add page tile one swipe past your last page gives you a new one with a tap, or drag a widget past either edge of your pages. Each Light button picks its own light, or All lights, from the gear icon in Edit Mode; tap to toggle, or use its arrow (or the separate LED Controls widget) for full color, brightness, and effects in the LEDs overlay.

### [Printing](/1.1/guide/printing/)
The full printing workflow — file selection, preview, pre-print options, monitoring active prints, tune overlay, Z-offset baby steps, pressure advance, exclude object, and post-print summary.

![Print File Detail](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/print-detail.png)

### [Print Monitoring & Failure Detection](/1.1/guide/print-monitoring/)
The pre-print filament check that catches an empty slot before a multi-color print starts, and the on-screen response to camera-based print-failure detection on supported printers (Snapmaker U1, Creality K2).

### [Temperature Control](/1.1/guide/temperature/)
Nozzle and bed temperature panels, multi-extruder selector for printers with multiple extruders, material presets, and live temperature graphs.

### [Motion & Positioning](/1.1/guide/motion/)
Jog and Move tabs, tap-to-move coordinates, bed position grid, park, homing, distance increments, and emergency stop.

![Motion Controls](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-motion-panel.png)

### [Filament Management](/1.1/guide/filament/)
Extrusion controls, load/unload procedures, AMS multi-material systems with multi-backend support (run Happy Hare, AFC, ACE, or Tool Changer simultaneously), Spoolman integration, and filament drying and humidity monitoring.

![AMS Panel](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/ams.png)

### [Filament Tracking & Spoolman](/1.1/guide/filament-tracking/)
How HelixScreen tracks material, color, and remaining weight — with the built-in tracker or a connected Spoolman server. Covers the difference between the two modes, how usage is estimated during a print, connecting a Spoolman server, and browsing your spool inventory on the touchscreen.

### [Bluetooth Setup](/1.1/guide/bluetooth-setup/)
Enable Bluetooth on Raspberry Pi or BTT Pi when it's disabled for UART, or add a USB Bluetooth dongle when your MCU uses the serial port.

### [Label Printing](/1.1/guide/label-printing/)
Print spool labels to Brother QL, Phomemo, Niimbot, or MakeID thermal printers via Network, USB, or Bluetooth. Setup, label sizes, and troubleshooting.

### [Barcode Scanner](/1.1/guide/barcode-scanner/)
Set up a USB or Bluetooth barcode scanner to read Spoolman QR codes. Includes the `ClassicBondedOnly=false` fix for Bluetooth HID scanners that fail the "bonded device" check.

### [Calibration & Tuning](/1.1/guide/calibration/)
Bed mesh visualization, screws tilt adjust, input shaper resonance testing, Z-offset calibration, pressure advance measurement, and PID tuning.

![Bed Mesh](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-bed-mesh-panel.png)

### [Touch Calibration](/1.1/guide/touch-calibration/)
Fix taps that land in the wrong spot — run the calibration wizard from Settings, force it on any touchscreen, or recalibrate from the command line.

### [Settings](/1.1/guide/settings/)
Twelve pages in three groups. Screen: display, appearance and themes, touch & input, sound. Printer: printing, devices, safety & alerts, connection. HelixScreen: language & time, system, updates, help & about.

![Settings](../../../../assets/images/docs/1.1/screenshot-settings-panel.png)

### [Fans](/1.1/guide/fans/)
Discovered fans grouped by controllable vs. automatic, fan types, live speed control via animated dials, RPM readouts, and per-fan renaming.

### [Add-On Chamber Heater Setup](/1.1/guide/chamber-heater/)
Getting a BIGTREETECH Panda Breath working with Klipper so HelixScreen can see it — putting it on the network, choosing between stock and DragonBreath firmware, the module and config each one needs, the Snapmaker U1 one-menu shortcut, and what to do when it goes offline.

### [Sensors](/1.1/guide/sensors/)
Filament switch and motion sensors with per-sensor role assignment (None, Runout, Toolhead, Entry), read-only probe/width/humidity/accelerometer/color/temperature sensors, and chamber heater/sensor assignment.

### [Security & Screen Lock](/1.1/guide/security/)
Set, change, or remove a PIN screen lock, auto-lock tied to the display sleep timeout, the lock-screen keypad with emergency-stop access, and what a factory reset clears.

### [Camera](/1.1/guide/camera/)
Webcam viewing via the home widget and standalone fullscreen viewer, rotation and flip configuration, stream status states, and performance throttling.

### [Print History](/1.1/guide/print-history/)
History dashboard with time-range statistics and trend charts, searchable/filterable/sortable job list, per-job details, and reprinting a previous job.

### [Advanced Features](/1.1/guide/advanced/)
Console, macro execution, power device control (with home panel quick-toggle and device selection), print history, notification history, and timelapse settings.

### [Beta Features](/1.1/guide/beta-features/)
How to enable beta features, the full beta feature list, and update channel selection.

### [Tips & Best Practices](/1.1/guide/tips/)
Workflow shortcuts, quick troubleshooting table, and a "which panel do I use?" reference.
