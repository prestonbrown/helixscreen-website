Everything you need to run HelixScreen on a Flashforge Adventurer 5M or 5M Pro (AD5M): install, update, service control, and uninstall. HelixScreen runs directly on the printer's stock 4.3" touchscreen, replacing GuppyScreen (on Forge-X) or KlipperScreen (on Klipper Mod).

> **Tested versions:** Most thoroughly tested on Forge-X 1.4.0 with Flashforge firmware 3.1.5. Other versions may work fine.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:**
  - Flashforge Adventurer 5M or 5M Pro
  - Stock 4.3" touchscreen (800x480)
  - Network connection

- **Software:**
  - Custom Klipper firmware: [Forge-X](https://github.com/DrA1ex/ff5m) **or** [Klipper Mod](https://github.com/xblax/flashforge_ad5m_klipper_mod)
  - SSH access to the printer (usually `root@<printer-ip>`)
  - About 100MB free disk space

### Firmware Variants

The installer automatically detects which firmware you're running and configures paths accordingly:

| Firmware | Replaces | Install Location | Init Script |
|----------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Forge-X** | GuppyScreen | `/opt/helixscreen/` | `S90helixscreen` |
| **Klipper Mod** | KlipperScreen | `/root/printer_software/helixscreen/` | `S80helixscreen` |

> Klipper Mod **v00.06 and newer** installs to `/opt/helixscreen/` (still `S80helixscreen`); `/root/printer_software/helixscreen/` is the v00.05-and-older location.

On Klipper Mod, swapping KlipperScreen for HelixScreen frees a substantial chunk of the AD5M's limited RAM; see [Memory Constraints](#memory-constraints) below.

### Forge-X: Set Up GUPPY Mode First

**Important:** Forge-X must be installed and configured for GuppyScreen mode **before** installing HelixScreen. HelixScreen uses Forge-X's infrastructure (Klipper, Moonraker, backlight control) but replaces the GuppyScreen UI.

1. Install Forge-X following [their instructions](https://github.com/DrA1ex/ff5m)
2. Configure Forge-X with `display = 'GUPPY'` in variables.cfg
3. Verify GuppyScreen works on the touchscreen
4. Then run the HelixScreen installer

For everything the installer then changes on Forge-X, see [What the Installer Does](#what-the-installer-does).

---

## Installation

> **Important:** Installing HelixScreen replaces your current screen UI (GuppyScreen on Forge-X, KlipperScreen on Klipper Mod). Make sure you have a backup method to access your printer (SSH, Mainsail/Fluidd web interface).

### Option 1: Ready-Made Firmware Image (Easiest)

We maintain a [ready-made firmware image](https://github.com/prestonbrown/ff5m), a fork of Forge-X 1.4.0 with HelixScreen pre-configured. This is the fastest way to get up and running:

1. Download the image from [github.com/prestonbrown/ff5m](https://github.com/prestonbrown/ff5m)
2. Copy it to a USB flash drive
3. Insert the flash drive into your AD5M or AD5M Pro and install

That's it: no SSH, no manual commands. HelixScreen will be ready to go after the firmware installs.

> If you already have Forge-X or Klipper Mod installed and prefer to add HelixScreen manually, continue with the options below.

### Option 2: Automated Install (Recommended)

The AD5M uses BusyBox, which doesn't support HTTPS downloads directly. This is a **two-step process**:
1. Download on your local computer (Steps 1-2)
2. SSH into the printer as root and run the installer (Step 3)

**Step 1: Download on your computer**

Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/latest) and download:
- `helixscreen-ad5m.zip` (the AD5M release archive)
- `install.sh` (the installer script, under "Assets")

Or use the command line (replace `vX.Y.Z` with the actual version):
```bash
VERSION=vX.Y.Z  # Check latest at https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/latest
wget "https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/download/${VERSION}/helixscreen-ad5m.zip"
wget https://releases.helixscreen.org/install.sh
```

**Step 2: Copy to your printer**

```bash
# AD5M requires -O flag for scp (BusyBox lacks sftp-server)
# Note: Use /data/ not /tmp/ - AD5M's /tmp is a tiny tmpfs (~54MB)
scp -O helixscreen-ad5m.zip install.sh root@<printer-ip>:/data/
```

> **Windows users:** The `-O` flag is not supported by Windows 11's built-in OpenSSH.
> Use one of these alternatives instead:
> - **WSL** (recommended): open a WSL terminal and run all commands as shown (Linux tools work natively)
> - **[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/)** (free, GUI): set the protocol to **SCP**, then drag and drop files to `/data/` on the printer
> - **[PuTTY pscp](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)** (free, command-line):
>   `pscp helixscreen-ad5m.zip install.sh root@<printer-ip>:/data/`

**Step 3: SSH into the printer and run the installer**

```bash
# From your local computer, SSH into the printer as root
ssh root@<printer-ip>

# Now on the printer, run the installer
sh /data/install.sh --local /data/helixscreen-ad5m.zip
```

The install script automatically detects your firmware (Forge-X or Klipper Mod) and installs to the correct location.

### Option 3: Manual Install (Advanced)

<details>
<summary>Forge-X Manual Installation</summary>

```bash
# Download on your computer (replace vX.Y.Z with actual version)
VERSION=vX.Y.Z
wget "https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/download/${VERSION}/helixscreen-ad5m.zip"

# Copy to printer (AD5M requires scp -O for legacy protocol)
# Note: Use /data/ not /tmp/ - AD5M's /tmp is a tiny tmpfs (~54MB)
# Windows users: use WinSCP (SCP protocol) or PuTTY's pscp instead - see note above
scp -O helixscreen-ad5m.zip root@<printer-ip>:/data/

# SSH into printer
ssh root@<printer-ip>

# Extract to /opt (Forge-X location)
cd /opt
unzip -q /data/helixscreen-ad5m.zip

# Stop GuppyScreen
/opt/config/mod/.root/S80guppyscreen stop 2>/dev/null || true
chmod -x /opt/config/mod/.root/S80guppyscreen

# Install init script
cp /opt/helixscreen/config/helixscreen.init /etc/init.d/S90helixscreen
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S90helixscreen

# Start HelixScreen
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen start

# Clean up
rm /data/helixscreen-ad5m.zip
```

<details>
<summary>Klipper Mod Manual Installation</summary>

> **Note:** Klipper Mod's `/tmp` is a small tmpfs (~54MB). The package is ~70MB, so we must use `/mnt/data` instead.

```bash
# Download on your computer (replace vX.Y.Z with actual version)
VERSION=vX.Y.Z
wget "https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/download/${VERSION}/helixscreen-ad5m.zip"

# Copy to printer's data partition (NOT /tmp - it's too small!)
# Windows users: use WinSCP (SCP protocol) or PuTTY's pscp instead - see note above
scp -O helixscreen-ad5m.zip root@<printer-ip>:/mnt/data/

# SSH into printer
ssh root@<printer-ip>

# Extract to /root/printer_software (Klipper Mod location)
cd /root/printer_software
unzip -q /mnt/data/helixscreen-ad5m.zip

# Stop KlipperScreen
/etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen stop 2>/dev/null || true
chmod -x /etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen

# Install init script (S80 to match KlipperScreen's boot order)
cp /root/printer_software/helixscreen/config/helixscreen.init /etc/init.d/S80helixscreen
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S80helixscreen

# Update the install path in the init script
sed -i 's|DAEMON_DIR=.*|DAEMON_DIR="/root/printer_software/helixscreen"|' /etc/init.d/S80helixscreen

# Start HelixScreen
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen start

# Clean up
rm /mnt/data/helixscreen-ad5m.zip
```

</details>

> **Note:** AD5M runs as root, so `sudo` is not needed.
> **Note:** AD5M uses BusyBox utilities. Use `unzip` to extract `.zip` archives.
> **Note:** AD5M uses SysV init (BusyBox), not systemd.

### Reboot and Complete Setup

```bash
reboot
```

After reboot, HelixScreen will start automatically on the touchscreen. Use the touchscreen to complete the setup wizard; the printer should auto-detect since it's running locally. At the wizard's Moonraker Connection step, use `localhost`.

---

## What the Installer Does

Before proceeding, the installer checks that Klipper and Moonraker appear to be running and warns if either is missing; a piped install (`curl ... | sh`) continues after the warning, while an interactive one asks you to confirm.

**On Forge-X:**
- Sets Forge-X's display mode to `GUPPY` if it is not already (Forge-X itself must be installed and configured first; see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))
- Stops and disables GuppyScreen (`chmod -x` on init scripts)
- Disables stock Flashforge UI in `/opt/auto_run.sh`
- Patches `/opt/config/mod/.shell/screen.sh` to skip backlight commands when HelixScreen is running (prevents Forge-X's delayed_gcode from dimming the screen)
- Installs HelixScreen to `/opt/helixscreen/`
- Creates init script at `/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen`

**On Klipper Mod:**
- Stops Xorg and KlipperScreen
- Disables their init scripts (`chmod -x`)
- Installs HelixScreen to `/root/printer_software/helixscreen/`
- Creates init script at `/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen`

On uninstall, all of this is reversed and your previous UI is restored; see [Uninstalling](#uninstalling).

---

## Service Control and Logs

AD5M uses SysV init (BusyBox), not systemd. The service script name depends on your firmware variant.

**Forge-X:**
```bash
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen start|stop|restart|status
tail -100 /opt/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log    # launcher / crash capture
tail -100 /data/.helixscreen/logs/helix.log      # structured app log
```

**Klipper Mod:**
```bash
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen start|stop|restart|status
tail -100 /root/printer_software/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log
tail -100 /data/.helixscreen/logs/helix.log
```

There are two log streams; collect both when reporting an issue:

- **Launcher / crash capture** (startup, crash output): `/opt/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log` on Forge-X, `/root/printer_software/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log` on Klipper Mod
- **Structured app log:** `/data/.helixscreen/logs/helix.log` on both firmwares. The app writes this file directly to flash; the system syslog only captures the earliest startup output, before the app's own logging takes over

### Disabling the Previous UI Manually

The installer does this automatically. If you ever need to do it by hand:

**Forge-X (SysV init):**
```bash
# Disable GuppyScreen
/opt/config/mod/.root/S80guppyscreen stop
chmod -x /opt/config/mod/.root/S80guppyscreen
```

**Klipper Mod (SysV init):**
```bash
# Disable KlipperScreen
/etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen stop
chmod -x /etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen
```

---

## Updating

### Check Your Current Version

On the touchscreen: **Settings** → scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the version number.

Or via SSH:
```bash
# Forge-X:
/opt/helixscreen/bin/helix-screen --version

# Klipper Mod:
/root/printer_software/helixscreen/bin/helix-screen --version
```

### Update to the Latest Version

Same two-step process as installing (the AD5M has no HTTPS support), but you only need to copy the zip and you use the `install.sh` bundled with your existing install:

```bash
# On your computer (replace vX.Y.Z with actual version):
VERSION=vX.Y.Z  # Check latest at https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/latest
wget "https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/download/${VERSION}/helixscreen-ad5m.zip"
# Windows users: use WSL, WinSCP (SCP protocol), or PuTTY's pscp instead of scp -O
scp -O helixscreen-ad5m.zip root@<printer-ip>:/data/

# On the printer (use the bundled install.sh - no need to download it again):
# Forge-X:
/opt/helixscreen/install.sh --local /data/helixscreen-ad5m.zip --update
# Klipper Mod:
/root/printer_software/helixscreen/install.sh --local /data/helixscreen-ad5m.zip --update
```

This preserves your configuration and updates to the latest version. For the Windows transfer alternatives, see the note in [Step 2 of the automated install](#option-2-automated-install-recommended).

### Update to a Specific Version

Download the specific version archive from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases), then use `--local` as shown above. To reinstall a version with fresh settings instead of keeping your existing ones, see [UPGRADING.md](/1.1/upgrading/) for `--version` and `--clean`.

---

## Uninstalling

### Automated Uninstall (Recommended)

The bundled installer's `--uninstall` removes HelixScreen and restores your previous UI (GuppyScreen on Forge-X, KlipperScreen on Klipper Mod):

```bash
# Forge-X:
cp /opt/helixscreen/install.sh /tmp/install.sh && sh /tmp/install.sh --uninstall
# Klipper Mod:
cp /root/printer_software/helixscreen/install.sh /tmp/install.sh && sh /tmp/install.sh --uninstall
```

> **Why copy it out?** The installer refuses to run `--uninstall` from inside the install directory: it would delete the script that is running it. Copying it to `/tmp` first avoids that.

On Forge-X, the uninstaller reverses everything listed in [What the Installer Does](#what-the-installer-does), including unpatching `screen.sh` and restoring backlight control.

### Manual Uninstall

<details>
<summary>AD5M Forge-X</summary>

```bash
# Stop and remove service
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen stop
rm /etc/init.d/S90helixscreen

# Remove files
rm -rf /opt/helixscreen

# Re-enable GuppyScreen
chmod +x /opt/config/mod/.root/S80guppyscreen 2>/dev/null || true
chmod +x /opt/config/mod/.root/S35tslib 2>/dev/null || true

# Restore stock Flashforge UI in auto_run.sh (if it was disabled)
sed -i 's|^# Disabled by HelixScreen: /opt/PROGRAM/ffstartup-arm|/opt/PROGRAM/ffstartup-arm|' /opt/auto_run.sh 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove HelixScreen patch from screen.sh (restores backlight control)
# The automated uninstaller handles this; for manual removal, edit:
# /opt/config/mod/.shell/screen.sh and remove the helixscreen_active check

# Reboot to restore GuppyScreen
reboot
```

> **Note:** The automated uninstaller (`install.sh --uninstall`) handles all Forge-X restoration automatically, including unpatching `screen.sh`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>AD5M Klipper Mod</summary>

```bash
# Stop and remove service
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen stop
rm /etc/init.d/S80helixscreen

# Remove files
rm -rf /root/printer_software/helixscreen

# Re-enable KlipperScreen
chmod +x /etc/init.d/S80klipperscreen 2>/dev/null || true

# Reboot to restore KlipperScreen
reboot
```
</details>

## Quirks and Notes

### Memory Constraints

The AD5M has limited RAM (~108MB total, with only ~24MB free after Klipper, Moonraker, and screen UI). HelixScreen is built with static linking and memory optimization for this environment.

**Measured memory comparison (VmRSS):**
| Component | KlipperScreen | HelixScreen |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Screen UI | ~50 MB (Python + X Server) | **~15 MB** (C++) |
| **Total** | ~50 MB | **~10 MB** |

On Klipper Mod systems, switching from KlipperScreen to HelixScreen frees approximately **35 MB** of RAM, a significant improvement on a memory-constrained device!

> **Note:** The ~15 MB footprint includes the full LVGL widget tree, draw buffers for UI elements (gradients, color pickers, AMS spool icons), and runtime state for all panels. Images are loaded on-demand, not pre-cached.

If you experience memory issues:
- Reduce print history retention in Moonraker
- Avoid keeping many G-code files on the printer
- Consider disabling the camera stream if not needed

### Screen Dims After a Few Seconds

If the screen dims to ~10% brightness shortly after boot (about 3 seconds after Klipper starts), the Forge-X backlight patch didn't get applied; this can happen on manual installs. See [Troubleshooting: screen dims after a few seconds](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md#screen-dims-after-a-few-seconds).
