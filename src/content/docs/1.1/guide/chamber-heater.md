An add-on chamber heater is a separate box that sits in your enclosure, heats the
air and filters it. The one HelixScreen understands in detail is the **BIGTREETECH
Panda Breath**.

**HelixScreen does not install or configure it.** The heater is a network device
that talks to Klipper, so Klipper has to be told about it first — and that part is
the same whether or not you use HelixScreen. Once Klipper knows about it,
HelixScreen finds it on its own with nothing for you to set: the chamber
temperature appears in the Temperatures widget, presets can set a chamber target,
and a diagnostics card shows the heater's health.

This page covers getting Klipper to that point. What you see afterwards is in
[Temperature](temperature.md#chamber-heater-diagnostics).

---

## Step 1 — Put the heater on your network

Power the unit up and join it to your Wi-Fi following BIGTREETECH's instructions
(the unit publishes its own setup access point on first boot). Then find the
address your Klipper host can reach it at — either its IP address from your
router, or the name it advertises, usually `PandaBreath.local`.

Check from the machine Klipper runs on:

```bash
ping PandaBreath.local
```

If the name does not resolve, use the IP address everywhere below instead. Give
the unit a DHCP reservation in your router if you can — the address ends up in
your Klipper config, and a heater that moves address goes offline.

---

## Step 2 — Choose which firmware it runs

Two firmwares work with HelixScreen. You do not have to change anything to use
the one it came with.

| | **Stock** (as shipped) | **DragonBreath** (third-party) |
|---|---|---|
| Flashing needed | No | Yes, over Wi-Fi |
| Chamber heating and filtration | Yes | Yes |
| Filament drying | Yes, from HelixScreen or the unit | From the unit only |
| Fault reporting in HelixScreen | No | Yes, with a **Reset** button |
| Filter-fan speed and control in HelixScreen | No | Yes |
| Heating-element temperature in HelixScreen | No | Yes |
| Offline warning in HelixScreen | Yes | Yes |

Stock is fine, and it is the right choice if you would rather not flash anything.
DragonBreath reports more, so HelixScreen can show more. Everything in the rest of
this page applies to both unless a step says otherwise.

## Step 3 — Tell Klipper about the heater

Klipper needs two things: a small add-on module, and a few lines in your config.
Both projects below ship an installer that does it for you.

You need SSH access to the machine running Klipper.

### If you are on stock firmware

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/justinh-rahb/pandabreath-klipper
cd pandabreath-klipper
./install.sh --host PandaBreath.local
sudo systemctl restart klipper
```

Use `--dry-run` first if you want to see what it will change. If your Klipper
install is in a non-standard place, the installer takes `--klipper-dir`,
`--config-dir` and `--printer-cfg` to point it at the right paths.

To write the config by hand instead, copy `panda_breath.py` into Klipper's
`klippy/extras/` folder and add this to `printer.cfg`:

```ini
[panda_breath]
firmware: stock
host: PandaBreath.local
port: 80

[heater_generic panda_breath]
heater_pin: panda_breath:pwm
sensor_type: panda_breath
control: watermark
max_delta: 0.5
min_temp: 15
max_temp: 80

[verify_heater panda_breath]
check_gain_time: 360
hysteresis: 5
heating_gain: 1
```

Aim to have the unit on BIGTREETECH firmware **1.0.3 or newer** — earlier
versions are missing sensor fault detection.

### If you are on DragonBreath firmware

Flash it first: open the unit's own web page in a browser, use its **Firmware
Update** feature to upload the `dragonbreath-<version>.bin` file from the
[project's releases](https://github.com/plastikman/DragonBreath/releases), and let
it reboot. It carries your Wi-Fi settings across, so it should rejoin by itself.
The stock firmware stays on the unit and you can switch back to it later.

Then install the Klipper side:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/plastikman/dragonbreath-klipper
cd dragonbreath-klipper
./install.sh
sudo systemctl restart klipper
```

Set the address in the `[dragonbreath]` section of your config:

```ini
[dragonbreath]
host: dragonbreath.local   # or the unit's IP address

[heater_generic dragonbreath]
heater_pin: dragonbreath:pwm
sensor_type: dragonbreath
control: watermark
max_delta: 2.0
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 75

[verify_heater dragonbreath]
check_gain_time: 300
hysteresis: 5
heating_gain: 1

[output_pin dragonbreath_filter]
pin: dragonbreath:filter
```

The `[output_pin]` section is what gives you the filter-fan toggle in HelixScreen.

To have Moonraker keep the module updated, add this to `moonraker.conf`:

```ini
[update_manager dragonbreath-klipper]
type: git_repo
path: ~/dragonbreath-klipper
origin: https://github.com/plastikman/dragonbreath-klipper.git
primary_branch: main
managed_services: klipper
```

> **The two section names must match.** `[panda_breath]` goes with
> `[heater_generic panda_breath]`; `[dragonbreath]` goes with
> `[heater_generic dragonbreath]`. If they differ, Klipper will not start.

### Snapmaker U1 with extended firmware

Nothing to install and no files to edit — it is already on the printer.

1. Open `http://<your-printer-ip>:9091` in a browser.
2. Find **Panda Breath Chamber Heater** under Snapmaker Components.
3. Set it to **Auto** (recommended) or **Manual**, and enter the heater's address
   when asked.

**Auto** lets the unit hold the chamber itself once the bed is hot, which is
gentler on long prints; HelixScreen shows **Mode: External** while it is doing
that. **Manual** keeps every decision with Klipper. Either works with HelixScreen.

Setting it back to **Disabled** removes the configuration cleanly.

---

## Step 4 — Restart and check

Restart Klipper (`FIRMWARE_RESTART` from any console, or the menu in
Fluidd/Mainsail). If Klipper refuses to start, the error names the section it did
not like — usually a typo in a section name, or the two names not matching.

In HelixScreen you should now see:

- A **chamber row** in the Temperatures widget on the home panel
- A **chamber target** you can set from the temperature panel and from presets
  that call for one, such as ABS
- A **diagnostics card** under the graph when you open the chamber temperature
  view — see [Temperature](temperature.md#chamber-heater-diagnostics) for what
  each part of it means
- On stock firmware, a **Start Drying** button on that card — see
  [Drying Filament in the Chamber](temperature.md#drying-filament-in-the-chamber)

Nothing needs to be enabled in HelixScreen for any of that.

---

## If HelixScreen picks the wrong heater

HelixScreen picks the chamber heater by name, and gets it right for anything
called `chamber`, `enclosure`, `cavity`, or named after the appliance. If your
setup has more than one generic heater and it chooses badly, set it yourself:

**Settings > Devices > Sensors > Temperature Sensors**, then use the **Chamber Heater**
dropdown. Leaving it on **Auto** keeps the automatic pick; **None** disables the
chamber entirely.

Note that choosing a different heater there also turns off the diagnostics card,
because the diagnostics belong to the appliance rather than to whatever heater you
picked.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Heater offline" in the diagnostics card.** The unit has stopped answering on
the network while Klipper carries on reporting its last temperature. Check it has
power and is still on Wi-Fi. Brief dropouts are normal and are ignored; the
warning only appears once the unit has been unreachable for a while. A heater that
goes offline often usually has a weak signal where it sits, or an address that
changed — a DHCP reservation fixes the second.

**The chamber never reaches its target.** These heaters are slow, and the chamber
warms far more slowly than the heating element inside the unit. A target only a
few degrees above room temperature can also sit unreached for a long time. Check
your enclosure is actually closed.

**The target will not go above a certain point.** Both firmwares cap what they
accept — DragonBreath refuses targets above 70 °C — and HelixScreen will not offer
more than the limit in your config's `max_temp`.

**"Mode: External" is showing and I did not do that.** Something other than
HelixScreen is driving the heater: the unit's own web page, a button on the unit,
or its built-in Auto mode. It is informational, not a fault.

**The filter fan says "Device" and the toggle will not respond.** The unit is
running the fan itself — during warm-up, or purging after a heating cycle — and
your request cannot override it. It returns to normal when the unit is done.

## A note on security

The stock firmware's network interface has no password. Anyone on your network can
reach the heater and turn it on. Keep it on a trusted network, and do not forward
its port to the internet.
