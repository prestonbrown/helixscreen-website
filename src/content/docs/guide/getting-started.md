Welcome to HelixScreen — a modern touchscreen interface for Klipper 3D printers. It connects to your printer via Moonraker and provides intuitive controls for printing, temperature management, calibration, and more.

## Quick Reference

| Sidebar Icon | Panel | What You'll Do There |
|--------------|-------|----------------------|
| Home | Home | Monitor status, start prints, view temperatures |
| Tune | Controls | Move axes, set temperatures, control fans |
| Spool | Filament | Load/unload filament, manage AMS slots |
| Gear | Settings | Configure display, sound, network, sensors |
| More | Advanced | Calibration, history, macros, system tools |

---

## Navigation Basics

HelixScreen uses a consistent layout:

- **Left sidebar**: Five navigation buttons to switch between main panels
- **Home button**: Tapping Home returns to the Home panel (to whichever page you were last viewing). Tapping Home again while already on the Home panel jumps to the main (first) page.
- **Back arrow**: Returns from sub-panels to the parent panel
- **Tap**: Select buttons, open panels, activate controls
- **Swipe**: Scroll through lists and long content

> **Note:** The Print Select panel is accessed by tapping the print area on the Home panel, not from the sidebar. The Controls and Filament panels require an active printer connection.

## Touch Screen Basics

HelixScreen supports these touch interactions:

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Tap** | Select buttons, open panels, toggle options |
| **Swipe** | Scroll lists, move through content |
| **Long press** | Access alternate characters on keyboard |
| **Swipe left/right on Home panel** | Switch between widget pages |
| **Pinch/spread** | Zoom 3D views (G-code preview, bed mesh) |

Temperature displays are tappable shortcuts — tap the nozzle or bed temperature on the Home panel to jump directly to that temperature control panel.

---

## Connection Status

The Home panel shows your printer connection status:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Green checkmark | Connected and ready |
| Red X | Disconnected (auto-reconnect in progress) |
| Yellow exclamation | Klipper not ready (firmware restart needed) |

When disconnected, a toast notification appears and HelixScreen attempts to reconnect automatically every few seconds.

## First-Time Setup

When you first start HelixScreen, the Setup Wizard guides you through initial configuration. You can re-run the wizard anytime via **Settings > Factory Reset**.

### Setup Wizard

The first time you launch HelixScreen, a setup wizard guides you through configuration. The wizard adapts to your hardware — steps that don't apply to your setup are automatically skipped.

**Core steps (always shown):**

1. **WiFi Setup** — Scan and connect to your network
2. **Printer Connection** — Enter your printer's IP address or hostname. HelixScreen tests the connection to Moonraker before continuing.
3. **Heater Selection** — Choose your bed and hotend heaters from the hardware detected on your printer
4. **Fan Selection** — Choose your part cooling and hotend fans
5. **Summary** — Review all your selections and save

**Conditional steps (shown when hardware is detected):**

| Step | Appears When |
|------|-------------|
| **Touch Calibration** | Resistive touchscreen detected (not yet calibrated) |
| **Language Selection** | Language not previously set on this device |
| **Printer Identification** | Printer model auto-detection suggests options (K1, K2, etc.) |
| **AMS / Filament System** | An AMS, CFS, Happy Hare, or other filament system is detected |
| **LED Configuration** | Addressable LED strips (NeoPixel, RGB) are discovered |
| **Filament Sensor Setup** | Multiple filament runout sensors are detected |
| **Input Shaper** | An accelerometer is detected on the printer |

The progress indicator (e.g., "Step 3 of 8") only counts the steps that apply to your setup — skipped steps aren't shown or counted.

> **Tip:** You can always go back to previous steps using the **Back** button. The connection test in step 2 must pass before you can proceed.

For details on touch screen calibration, see the [Touch Calibration Guide](/docs/guide/touch-calibration/).

### WiFi Configuration

If your device needs WiFi:

1. Available networks appear in a list
2. Tap a network to select it
3. Enter the password using the on-screen keyboard
4. Tap **Connect** and wait for confirmation

The wizard shows signal strength for each network and indicates which one you're currently connected to. If you're using Ethernet, you'll see your connection status on the left — just skip ahead with **Next**.

### Printer Connection

![Printer Connection](../../../assets/images/docs/wizard-connection.png)

Enter your Moonraker connection details:

- **Hostname or IP**: Your printer's address (e.g., `voron.local` or `192.168.1.100`)
- **Port**: Defaults to `7125` (auto-filled when you tap **Test Connection** if left empty)
- **API Key**: Only needed if Moonraker requires authentication

Tap **Test Connection** to verify before continuing. If the port field is empty, it auto-fills with the default port `7125`. HelixScreen auto-discovers printers on your network when possible — tap a discovered printer to auto-fill the connection details.

## On-Screen Keyboard

The keyboard appears automatically for text input:

- **QWERTY layout** with number row
- **Long-press** for alternate characters (hold 'a' for '@', etc.)
- **?123 button**: Switch to symbols
- **ABC button**: Switch to letters
- **Shift**: Toggle uppercase

---

## USB Mouse & Keyboard

HelixScreen automatically detects USB mice and keyboards when plugged in at startup:

- **USB Mouse**: Works alongside the touchscreen — both are active simultaneously. A small white cursor dot appears on screen when a mouse is detected.
- **USB Keyboard**: Detected automatically. Useful for text entry fields like Wi-Fi passwords or console commands.
- **Combo devices** (e.g., Logitech K400 keyboard with trackpad): Both keyboard and trackpad functions work automatically.

Devices must be connected before HelixScreen starts. Hot-plugging is not currently supported — restart HelixScreen after connecting a new device.

**Manual override:** If auto-detection doesn't find your device, you can specify the path directly:
```bash
# In helixscreen.env
HELIX_MOUSE_DEVICE=/dev/input/event4
HELIX_KEYBOARD_DEVICE=/dev/input/event5
```

To find your device path, run `cat /proc/bus/input/devices` and look for your device name.
