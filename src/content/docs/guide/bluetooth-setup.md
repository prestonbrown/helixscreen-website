HelixScreen uses Bluetooth for two things:

- **Label printers** — Brother QL, Phomemo, Niimbot, MakeID
- **Barcode scanners** — wireless HID scanners for filament spool tagging

Most Raspberry Pi and BTT Pi boards already have Bluetooth built in. The only real complication is that the radio shares hardware with the GPIO serial port (UART), so a Klipper install that talks to its MCU over UART will usually have Bluetooth disabled to free the port up.

**Good news:** if your printer's MCU is connected by **USB** (which is the most common setup — anything plugged into a USB port on the Pi qualifies), the UART is free and Bluetooth is just a few commands away. That's the path covered in **Option A** below, and it's the one you probably want.

If you genuinely need the UART for your MCU and can't give it up, skip to **Option B** for the USB dongle approach.

## Quick Check: Is Bluetooth Working?

Run this command on your Pi:

```bash
bluetoothctl show
```

If you see an adapter listed with `Powered: yes`, Bluetooth is ready — no further setup needed.

If you see `No default controller available`, Bluetooth is either not present or disabled. Read on.

## Why Bluetooth Might Be Disabled

On Raspberry Pi and BTT Pi boards, the Bluetooth adapter and the hardware UART (`ttyAMA0`) share the same serial interface. By default, the Pi maps `ttyAMA0` to Bluetooth and gives GPIO serial traffic the less-capable "mini UART."

Many Klipper setups override this to give the MCU the full hardware UART for reliable communication:

```
# /boot/config.txt (Raspberry Pi) or /boot/BoardEnv.txt (BTT Pi)
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

or equivalently:

```
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
```

The first (`disable-bt`) disables Bluetooth entirely and gives the full UART to GPIO. The second (`miniuart-bt`) moves Bluetooth to the mini UART (which often doesn't work reliably for Bluetooth).

---

## Option A: Enable Built-In Bluetooth (No UART Needed)

This is the simple path. Use it if your printer's MCU connects to the Pi over **USB** (or any way that doesn't use the GPIO UART pins). Once you finish these steps you'll be able to pair both label printers and Bluetooth barcode scanners from inside HelixScreen.

> **Not sure if you're using UART?** Quick test: `grep -E 'disable-bt|miniuart-bt' /boot/firmware/config.txt /boot/config.txt /boot/BoardEnv.txt 2>/dev/null`. If nothing prints, you're not using UART for serial — Option A is for you. If a `disable-bt` line shows up *and you need it for your MCU*, jump to Option B.

### Raspberry Pi (All Models)

1. Edit the boot config:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
   ```

   > **Note:** On older Raspberry Pi OS versions, the file is `/boot/config.txt` instead of `/boot/firmware/config.txt`.

2. Find and comment out or remove the Bluetooth disable line:

   ```
   # dtoverlay=disable-bt      ← comment out with #
   ```

   Also remove `dtoverlay=miniuart-bt` if present.

3. Enable the Bluetooth service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable hciuart
   sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
   ```

4. Reboot:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

5. Verify after reboot:

   ```bash
   bluetoothctl show
   ```

### BTT Pi (v1 / v2)

The BTT Pi uses a similar device tree overlay system but the config file location differs.

1. Edit the board environment file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /boot/BoardEnv.txt
   ```

2. Find and comment out or remove the Bluetooth disable overlay:

   ```
   # dtoverlay=disable-bt      ← comment out with #
   ```

3. Enable the Bluetooth service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable hciuart
   sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
   ```

4. Reboot:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

5. Verify after reboot:

   ```bash
   bluetoothctl show
   ```

## Option B: Add a USB Bluetooth Dongle (UART Still in Use)

If your printer's MCU communicates over UART and you can't give that up, the simplest solution is a **USB Bluetooth dongle**. These are inexpensive, widely available, and work alongside the disabled built-in adapter.

### Recommended Dongles

Most USB Bluetooth 4.0+ dongles work out of the box with Linux. Look for dongles based on these chipsets:

| Chipset | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Realtek RTL8761B** | Very common, cheap (~$5-8), BT 5.0, excellent Linux support |
| **Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR)** | Classic budget option, BT 4.0, widely compatible |
| **Broadcom BCM20702** | Reliable, good BLE support |

> **Tip:** Any dongle marketed as "Linux compatible" or "Bluetooth 4.0+" should work. BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) support is required for Niimbot printers.

### Setup

1. Plug the USB Bluetooth dongle into any available USB port on your Pi.

2. Check that the system detects it:

   ```bash
   bluetoothctl show
   ```

   You should see an adapter listed. If you have both built-in (disabled) and USB adapters, only the USB one will appear.

3. If the adapter shows `Powered: no`, power it on:

   ```bash
   bluetoothctl power on
   ```

4. Enable Bluetooth to start on boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
   ```

5. Verify everything is working:

   ```bash
   bluetoothctl show
   ```

   You should see `Powered: yes` and a valid Bluetooth address.

That's it — no reboot required for USB dongles. HelixScreen will detect the adapter automatically.

### If the Dongle Isn't Detected

Some dongles need a firmware file. Check the kernel log:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i bluetooth
```

If you see firmware errors, install the firmware package:

```bash
sudo apt install bluetooth bluez firmware-realtek
```

Then unplug and replug the dongle.

## Verifying Bluetooth Works with HelixScreen

Once Bluetooth is enabled (either built-in or via dongle), test it from whichever feature you're setting up:

**For a label printer:**

1. Open HelixScreen
2. Go to **Settings > Label Printer**
3. Set **Connection** to **Bluetooth**
4. Tap **Scan** — your label printer should appear in the list

**For a Bluetooth barcode scanner:**

1. Put the scanner in pairing mode (check its manual — usually a long-press or a setup barcode)
2. Go to **Settings > Hardware > Barcode Scanner**
3. Tap **Scan for devices** — your scanner should appear in the list
4. Tap to pair. See the [Barcode Scanner guide](/docs/guide/barcode-scanner/) for the full walkthrough.

If neither feature shows a Bluetooth option, HelixScreen didn't detect an adapter. Double-check with `bluetoothctl show`.

## Common Configurations

| Setup | Bluetooth Available? | Action Needed |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| Pi with MCU on USB, no UART overlay | Yes (built-in) | None — already works |
| Pi with `disable-bt` for UART MCU | No | Add USB dongle (Option B) |
| Pi with `miniuart-bt` | Unreliable | Remove overlay + add USB dongle (Option B) |
| Pi with no MCU on UART | No (disabled) | Enable built-in (Option A) |
| BTT Pi with `disable-bt` | No | Add USB dongle (Option B) |
| BTT Pi with no UART overlay | Yes (built-in) | None — already works |

---

## Troubleshooting

### `bluetoothctl show` says "No default controller available"

- No Bluetooth adapter is active. Either enable the built-in one (Option A) or plug in a USB dongle (Option B).

### Bluetooth adapter shows but is not powered

```bash
sudo bluetoothctl power on
```

If this doesn't persist across reboots, check that the `bluetooth` service is enabled:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

### USB dongle detected but scanning finds nothing

- Make sure your label printer is powered on and in discoverable mode.
- Some cheap dongles have poor BLE support. If you're using a Niimbot printer (BLE only), try a dongle with a Realtek RTL8761B chipset.

### Two adapters showing in `bluetoothctl`

If you re-enabled built-in Bluetooth while also having a USB dongle plugged in, you may see two adapters. This is fine — HelixScreen will use whichever is available. To select a specific one:

```bash
bluetoothctl select <MAC_ADDRESS>
```
