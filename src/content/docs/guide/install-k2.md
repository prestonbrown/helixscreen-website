End-to-end guide for the Creality K2, K2 Plus, and K2 Pro: install, update, and uninstall. HelixScreen runs on the stock firmware, in place of the stock screen UI.

> **Tested state:** works with stock firmware and stock Moonraker (no custom firmware required). Root access is enabled from the printer's own settings menu.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:**
  - Creality K2, K2 Plus, or K2 Pro
  - Stock 4.3" touchscreen display (480x800)
  - Network connection

- **Software:**
  - Stock firmware with root access enabled (Settings > "Root account information")
  - SSH access (`root@<printer-ip>`, password: `creality_2024`)
  - Moonraker is included in stock firmware; the wizard's default port (`7125`) needs no changes (Creality's own web front also reaches Moonraker through a proxy on 4408)

## Install

SSH into the printer and run:

```bash
python3 -c "import urllib.request as u;u.urlretrieve('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/main/scripts/install.sh','/tmp/install.sh')" && sh /tmp/install.sh
```

> **Why not `wget`?** Recent K2 firmware (Tina/OpenWrt) ships neither `wget` nor `curl` on the `PATH`: even the BusyBox `wget` applet has been compiled out. Every K2 includes `python3` (Klipper and Moonraker need it) with working SSL, so the command above uses Python to fetch the installer over HTTPS; the installer then uses Python for the rest of the download and extraction. If your firmware still has `wget` (older builds did), `wget -O - http://dl.helixscreen.org/install.sh | sh` also works.

After installation, the setup wizard runs on the touchscreen. Moonraker is already on the printer, so the wizard's connection step needs no changes.

## What the Installer Does Here

- Installs to `/opt/helixscreen/`, with a boot service at `/etc/init.d/S99helixscreen`
- Stops and persistently disables the stock Creality UI service (`/etc/init.d/app`), then brings Creality's `web-server` back up every time HelixScreen starts, so the printer's stock local-network status connection (port 9999) keeps answering. The Creality Cloud app and its camera stream do not work while HelixScreen is installed. HelixScreen also takes the chamber camera over for its own stream, unless Moonraker already lists an MJPEG camera with a stream URL that HelixScreen did not set up, or the release is missing its camera streamer
- Stages the download, caches, and logs on `/mnt/UDISK` (the large user partition): `/opt` sits on a small system overlay that a release archive would fill
- Waits up to two minutes for Moonraker during boot, then starts the UI anyway; it reconnects on its own

## Service Control and Logs

```bash
/etc/init.d/S99helixscreen start|stop|restart|status
```

Two log streams; collect both when reporting an issue:

```bash
# Structured app log (on the UDISK data partition, rotated):
tail -100 /mnt/UDISK/helixscreen/logs/helix.log
# Launcher / crash capture (lives beside the install; on builds whose
# /var/log is persistent it lands at /var/log/helixscreen/launcher.log):
tail -100 /opt/helixscreen/logs/launcher.log
# Anything that reached the OpenWrt syslog:
logread | grep helix-screen | tail -100
```

## Updating

Use the bundled installer (no need to download it again):

```bash
/opt/helixscreen/install.sh --update
```

To pin a specific version, add `--version vX.Y.Z` (find the latest on the [releases page](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/releases/latest)). Your settings are preserved; see [UPGRADING.md](/upgrading/) for what `--update` keeps and what `--clean` resets.

Check the current version over SSH:

```bash
/opt/helixscreen/bin/helix-screen --version
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
cp /opt/helixscreen/install.sh /tmp/install.sh && sh /tmp/install.sh --uninstall
```

This removes HelixScreen, re-enables and starts the stock Creality UI service (`/etc/init.d/app`), and hands the chamber camera back to the stock camera app, which also restores Creality's stock AI failure detection (see the note below).

## Quirks and Notes

**What's different from the K1:**
- ARM processor (Allwinner, not MIPS): standard cross-compilation
- Stock Moonraker: no community firmware required
- OpenWrt-based init system (procd, not SysV)
- CFS (Creality Filament System) support for RS-485 filament management

**Stock AI failure detection is disabled while HelixScreen is installed.** The stock detector rides the same service as the stock UI and watches the chamber camera, and HelixScreen takes over both. HelixScreen does not yet ship a replacement detector; one is tracked in [issue #1033](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/issues/1033). Uninstalling restores the stock detector.

**The portrait panel is software-rotated to landscape.** That is the supported configuration; running it un-rotated with the portrait layout is alpha and mostly untested. On this lower-power CPU, animations and 3D bed-mesh rendering may be throttled.
