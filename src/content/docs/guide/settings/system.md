The System section covers network configuration, hardware management, privacy settings, and maintenance actions.

## Network Settings

> Hidden on Android (the OS manages networking).

Tap to open the Network Settings overlay with a two-column layout:

**Left column — Status:**
- **WiFi** — Toggle on/off, view connection status (SSID, IP address, MAC address, signal strength). Shows a 2.4GHz indicator if your hardware only supports that band.
- **Ethernet** — View connection status (IP address, MAC address) — read-only, no toggle.
- **Test Network** — Verify internet connectivity. Disabled when no network is connected.

**Right column — Available Networks:**
- Scans and lists available WiFi networks with signal strength indicators
- Tap a network to connect (enter password if needed)
- **Add Hidden Network** — Connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID
- **Refresh** button to re-scan (shows a spinner while scanning)

---

## Host

Shows the current Moonraker host address (e.g., `localhost:7125`). Tap to open the **Change Host** dialog where you can enter a new IP address and port to connect to a different printer.

After changing the host, HelixScreen disconnects from the current printer and reconnects to the new one.

---

## Touch Calibration

> Only shown on touchscreen displays, not in the desktop simulator.

Recalibrate if taps register in the wrong location:

1. Tap **Touch Calibration** in Settings
2. Tap each crosshair target as it appears on screen
3. Calibration saves automatically

The row description shows "Calibrated" or "Not calibrated" status.

---

## Hardware Health

> Only shown when hardware issues are detected.

Tap to open the Hardware Health overlay, which lists detected issues:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Critical** | Required hardware missing (e.g., no extruder heater) |
| **Warning** | Expected hardware not found (e.g., bed sensor disappeared) |
| **Info** | Newly discovered hardware that wasn't seen before |
| **Session** | Hardware changed since last session |

**Actions for non-critical issues:**

- **Ignore** — Mark as optional (won't warn again even if missing)
- **Save** — Add to expected list (will warn if it disappears later)

Use this when adding or removing hardware to keep HelixScreen's expectations accurate.

---

## Plugins

> Only shown when beta features are enabled (tap Current Version 7 times in About).

View installed plugins and their status. Plugins extend HelixScreen with additional capabilities like custom LED effects, overlays, and integrations.

---

## Share Usage Data (Telemetry)

Toggle anonymous usage telemetry that helps improve HelixScreen. Data collection is completely anonymous — no personal information, printer names, or file names are ever sent.

When enabled, a **View Telemetry Data** row appears below the toggle. Tap it to see exactly what data will be sent. See the [Telemetry & Privacy](/docs/legal/telemetry/) documentation for full details on what is and isn't collected.

---

## Restart HelixScreen

Restart the display application. Useful after changing settings that require a restart (like theme changes) or if the UI becomes unresponsive. Shows a brief "Restarting..." toast before the app restarts.

---

## Factory Reset

Clears **all** HelixScreen settings and restarts the Setup Wizard. This resets:

- All appearance, display, and sound settings
- LED configuration
- Printer connection details
- Sensor roles and hardware expectations
- All other preferences

**Does not affect** your Klipper configuration, Moonraker, or any files on the printer itself.

---

## Install Update

> Only shown when an update is available.

Download and install the available HelixScreen update. Shows a confirmation dialog with the version number, then displays download progress with a cancel option. After download completes, prompts to restart.
