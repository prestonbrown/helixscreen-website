The Printer section contains settings for hardware connected to your printer. Items in this section appear or hide dynamically based on what HelixScreen detects from Klipper and Moonraker.

---

## Sensors

> Only shown when sensors are detected.

Tap to open the Sensor Settings overlay. Manage all detected filament sensors by choosing a role for each:

| Role | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Runout** | Pauses print when filament runs out |
| **Motion** | Detects filament movement (clog detection) |
| **Ignore** | Sensor present but not monitored |

Other detected sensors (accelerometers, probes, humidity, width, color) are listed as read-only information.

---

## AMS Management

> Only shown when an AMS (Automatic Material System) is detected.

Tap to open Device Operations for quick actions, calibration, and speed settings for multi-material systems. Supports AFC, Happy Hare, ACE, and other Klipper-based filament changers.

---

## Fans

> Only shown when fans are detected.

Tap to open the Fan Settings overlay. This shows all detected fans and their current speeds. You can rename any fan for easier identification — for example, rename "fan_generic exhaust_fan" to "Exhaust". Custom names appear everywhere fans are shown in the UI.

---

## Spoolman

> Only shown when Spoolman is configured in Moonraker.

Tap to open Spoolman integration settings. HelixScreen connects to your Spoolman server for spool tracking, weight sync, and barcode scanning.

### Server Setup

If Spoolman is not yet configured, you'll see a setup screen. Enter the IP address and port of your Spoolman server, then tap **Connect**. HelixScreen verifies the connection and configures Moonraker automatically — no manual editing of `moonraker.conf` needed.

### Server Status

When connected, the settings screen shows your Spoolman server URL along with options to **Change** the server address or **Remove** the configuration entirely.

### Sync with Spoolman

Toggle this on to enable automatic weight polling. When enabled, HelixScreen periodically queries Spoolman for spool weight updates and displays the remaining filament on the home panel and filament panel.

### Refresh Interval

Controls how often HelixScreen polls Spoolman for weight updates. Options: **30 seconds**, **1 minute**, **2 minutes**, or **5 minutes**. Shorter intervals give more up-to-date readings but generate more network traffic.

### Barcode Scanner

Configure which USB device to use as a barcode scanner for scanning Spoolman QR codes on spool labels. By default, HelixScreen auto-detects scanners by looking for devices with "barcode" or "scanner" in their name.

If your scanner uses a generic name (e.g., "TMS HIDKeyBoard"), tap this setting to manually select it from a list of connected USB HID devices. The selection is saved and persists across restarts.

### Label Printer

Opens label printer configuration for printing spool labels with QR codes. See [Label Printing](/docs/guide/label-printing/) for full setup instructions and supported printers.

## LED Settings

> Only shown when LED hardware is detected.

Tap to open the full LED configuration overlay. This is a large topic with its own page — see [LED Settings](/docs/guide/settings/led-settings/).

---

## Retraction Settings

> Only shown when firmware retraction (`[firmware_retraction]`) is configured in Klipper.

Tap to open the retraction overlay. Configure G10/G11 firmware retraction parameters. **Changes apply immediately** and can be adjusted mid-print for tuning.

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Enable Retraction** | On/Off | Master toggle for firmware retraction |
| **Retract Length** | 0–6 mm | Amount of filament to retract. 0.4–2 mm for direct drive, 4–6 mm for bowden. |
| **Retract Speed** | 10–80 mm/s | Speed of the retraction movement |
| **Unretract Extra** | 0–1 mm | Extra filament to prime after retraction to compensate for ooze |
| **Unretract Speed** | 10–60 mm/s | Speed of the prime (unretract) movement |

---

## Timelapse

> Only shown when the [Moonraker-Timelapse](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/moonraker-timelapse) plugin is installed.

Tap to open the Timelapse Settings overlay. Configure how HelixScreen records timelapse videos of your prints.

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Timelapse** | On/Off | Master toggle for timelapse recording |
| **Recording Mode** | Layer / Hyperlapse | **Layer** captures one frame at each layer change — best for most prints. **Hyperlapse** captures frames at fixed time intervals — better for very long prints. |
| **Framerate** | 15 / 24 / 30 / 60 fps | Playback speed of the rendered video. 30 fps is the default. |
| **Auto-render video** | On/Off | When enabled, automatically renders a video file when the print completes |

A quick **timelapse toggle** also appears on the print status panel, so you can enable or disable recording without leaving the print view.

Changes are saved immediately and sent to Moonraker. If the timelapse plugin is not yet installed, HelixScreen shows an **Install Wizard** that walks you through the SSH commands to set it up — see [Advanced > Timelapse](../advanced.md#timelapse) for details.

For browsing and playing recorded videos, see **Settings > Timelapse Videos** (also covered in [Advanced > Timelapse](../advanced.md#timelapse)).

## Macro Buttons

Tap to open the Macro Buttons overlay. Configure quick-action buttons and standard macro assignments.

### Quick Buttons

These macros power the buttons you see on the Controls and Filament panels:

| Button | Where it appears | What it does by default |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Cooldown** | Preheat widget (when heaters are on), Filament panel | Turns off extruder and bed heaters |
| **Load Filament** | Filament panel | Runs `LOAD_FILAMENT` |
| **Unload Filament** | Filament panel | Runs `UNLOAD_FILAMENT` |
| **Custom Macro 1** | Controls panel | Runs `HELIX_CLEAN_NOZZLE` (label: "Clean Nozzle") |
| **Custom Macro 2** | Controls panel | Runs `HELIX_BED_LEVEL_IF_NEEDED` (label: "Bed Level") |

**Cooldown behavior:** When you preheat a material using the Preheat widget on the home or controls panel, the button automatically switches to **Cool Down** while any heater target is above zero. Tapping it runs your configured cooldown macro. This is especially useful if your cooldown needs to do more than just turn off heaters — for example, turning off chamber heaters, bed fans, or recirculation fans.

You can customize any of these. Each button has a **label** (what the button says) and **G-code** (what it runs when tapped). The cooldown macro can be a simple G-code string or a multi-line sequence:

```
SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=extruder TARGET=0
SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=0
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=bed_fan SPEED=0
```

For advanced configuration via `settings.json`, see the [default_macros reference](../../CONFIGURATION.md#default_macros).

### Standard Macros

HelixScreen auto-detects common macros from your Klipper configuration (e.g., it recognizes `CLEAN_NOZZLE`, `NOZZLE_CLEAN`, and similar naming patterns). You can override any auto-detected assignment:

| Slot | What it controls | Common auto-detected macros |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Load Filament** | Filament load operations | LOAD_FILAMENT, M701 |
| **Unload Filament** | Filament unload operations | UNLOAD_FILAMENT, M702 |
| **Purge** | Nozzle purge/prime | PURGE, PURGE_LINE, LINE_PURGE, PRIME_LINE |
| **Pause** | Print pause | PAUSE, M600 |
| **Resume** | Print resume | RESUME |
| **Cancel** | Print cancel | CANCEL_PRINT |
| **Bed Mesh** | Bed mesh calibration | BED_MESH_CALIBRATE |
| **Bed Level** | Manual bed leveling | BED_SCREWS_ADJUST, SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE |
| **Clean Nozzle** | Nozzle cleaning | CLEAN_NOZZLE, NOZZLE_CLEAN |
| **Heat Soak** | Chamber heat soak | HEAT_SOAK |

If your printer doesn't have a matching macro, some slots fall back to HelixScreen helper macros (installed via **Settings > Advanced > Install HelixScreen Macros**). Leave a slot empty to disable that function.

> **Looking for Load/Unload/Purge button customization?** See the [Filament guide](../filament.md#customizing-which-macro-runs) for a step-by-step walkthrough, including how these buttons interact with AMS systems.

### Per-Material Preheat Macros

You can also assign a custom Klipper macro to each material preset (PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU). This is useful when preheating requires more than just setting temperatures — for example, turning on bed fans for ABS or starting a chamber heater.

Configure per-material macros in **Settings > Material Temperatures**. Each material can have:

- **Preheat Macro** — A Klipper macro to run when preheating this material
- **Macro Handles Heating** — If enabled, the macro is responsible for setting temperatures. If disabled, HelixScreen sets temperatures first, then runs the macro as an additional step.
