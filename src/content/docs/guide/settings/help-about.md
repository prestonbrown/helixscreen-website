## Help & Support

Three quick links at the bottom of the Settings panel:

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Upload Debug Bundle** | Collects logs and system info for support (see below) |
| **Discord Community** | Join **discord.gg/helixscreen** for community help and feedback |
| **Documentation** | Visit **helixscreen.org/docs** for guides and reference |

### Debug Bundles

When you need help troubleshooting an issue:

1. Tap **Upload Debug Bundle** in Settings
2. The bundle collects your logs, system info, and configuration (no personal data)
3. Tap **Upload** to send the bundle securely
4. Share the resulting code with the HelixScreen team on Discord or GitHub

Debug bundles include:

- **System logs** — recent HelixScreen log output
- **Configuration** — your settings (sanitized, no passwords or API keys)
- **System info** — OS version, hardware details, display resolution
- **Crash data** — if a crash occurred, the crash report and backtrace
- **Crash history** — past crash submissions with their GitHub issue references (helps support identify recurring issues)
- **Device identifier** — a double-hashed ID used only for correlating telemetry data (not personally identifiable)

Debug bundles contain only technical information needed for troubleshooting — no passwords, API keys, or personal data.

## About

Tap the **About** row at the bottom of the Settings panel to open the About overlay. This sub-overlay shows system information, update management, and HelixScreen branding.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HelixScreen Logo & Branding** | HelixScreen logo, "by Preston Brown", copyright notice, and a scrolling contributor marquee |
| **Printer Name** | The name of your connected printer (set during setup wizard) |
| **Current Version** | Your installed HelixScreen version |
| **Update Channel** | Stable, Beta, or Dev — only visible when beta features are enabled |

### Easter Eggs

- Tap the **Printer Name** row **seven times** to launch a hidden Snake game
- Tap the **Current Version** row **seven times** to toggle beta features — works like Android's "tap build number" developer mode

### Enabling Beta Features

Tap the **Current Version** row seven times in Settings → About to toggle beta features.

When beta features are enabled:
- **Update Channel** selector appears (Stable / Beta / Dev)
- Additional items appear in the Advanced panel (Macro Browser, Timelapse, etc.)

- Tap seven more times to disable

### Update Channels
