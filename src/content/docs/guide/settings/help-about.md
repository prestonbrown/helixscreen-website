## Help & About

Five items in the Help & About category:

| **Upload Debug Bundle** | Collects logs and system info for support (see below) |
| **Discord Community** | Join **discord.gg/RZCT2StKhr** for community help and feedback |
| **Documentation** | Visit **helixscreen.org/docs** for guides and reference |
| **About** | Version, updates, and printer info (see below) |

### Welcome Tour

The first time you launch HelixScreen (after finishing the setup wizard), a short guided tour walks you through the interface. It's an eight-step overlay that highlights one part of the screen at a time, with a **Skip** button to leave early, a **Next** button to move on (it reads **Done** on the last step), and a step counter so you know how far along you are.

The tour covers:

1. **Welcome to HelixScreen** — a quick hello.
2. **Your printer at a glance** — tap any home tile to open its full controls or toggle its state.
3. **Customize your home screen** — long-press any tile to enter edit mode and rearrange, resize, remove, or add widgets.
4. **Print status** — monitor prints in progress and pause, resume, or cancel the active job.
5. **Controls** — move the toolhead, home axes, level the bed, and tune temperatures and fans.
6. **Filament** — load, unload, and swap spools, and monitor your multi-filament system.
7. **Advanced** — macros, the G-code console, calibration tools, and firmware updates.
8. **Settings** — network, display, sound, printer setup, and more.

The tour runs on the Home screen; tapping a navigation button to leave Home ends it early. It also reappears automatically after a HelixScreen update introduces new tour content.

### Replaying the Tour

To see it again, tap **Replay Welcome Tour** at the top of **Settings → Help & About**. HelixScreen returns to the Home screen and restarts the tour from the beginning. This row is always available, so you can revisit the tour whenever you like.

### Debug Bundles

When you need help troubleshooting an issue:

1. Tap **Upload Debug Bundle** in Settings
2. The bundle collects your logs, system info, and configuration (no personal data)
3. Tap **Upload** to send the bundle securely
4. Share the resulting code with the HelixScreen team on Discord or GitHub

Debug bundles include:

- **System logs** - recent HelixScreen log output, starting from the very beginning of startup. That matters for problems that happen while HelixScreen is still loading your settings - a settings file that could not be read, or one that had to be restored from backup. On older versions those messages happened before the log was being kept, so the bundle showed no trace of them even though you saw the message on screen
- **Configuration** — your HelixScreen settings (sanitized, no passwords or API keys)
- **Printer configuration** — your Klipper `printer.cfg` and any files it includes, so support can see how your printer is actually set up (sanitized, see below)
- **Installed macros** — the names of your G-code macros (names only, not what they do)
- **System info** — OS version, hardware details, display resolution
- **Crash data** — if a crash occurred, the crash report and backtrace
- **Crash history** — past crash submissions with their GitHub issue references (helps support identify recurring issues)
- **Device identifier** — a double-hashed ID used only for correlating telemetry data (not personally identifiable)

Debug bundles contain technical information needed for troubleshooting. Before anything is uploaded, HelixScreen strips passwords, API keys and tokens, web-hook URLs (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Pushover, ntfy, IFTTT), usernames and passwords embedded in URLs, email addresses, and MAC addresses.

One thing worth knowing: your `printer.cfg` is your own file, and HelixScreen can only redact patterns it recognizes. File paths are left intact, so an include pointing at `/home/yourname/…` will show that name. If you keep something unusual in your printer config that you would rather not share, look at it before you send the code — and remember a share code is only as private as the people you give it to.

## About

Tap the **About** row at the bottom of the Settings panel to open the About overlay. This sub-overlay shows system information, update management, and HelixScreen branding.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **HelixScreen Logo & Branding** | HelixScreen logo, "by Preston Brown", copyright notice, and a scrolling contributor marquee |
| **Printer Name** | The name of your connected printer (set during setup wizard) |
| **Current Version** | Your installed HelixScreen version |
| **Update Channel** | Stable or Beta; **Dev** is added when beta features are enabled |
| **Check for Updates** | Check for and install new versions (hidden on Android) |
| **Klipper** | Installed Klipper version (fetched from Moonraker) |
| **Moonraker** | Installed Moonraker version |
| **OS** | Operating system version |
| **Print Hours** | Total print hours tracked — tap to open the [History Dashboard](/guide/advanced/) |
| **Open Source Licenses** | View licenses for all open source libraries used by HelixScreen |

### Checking for Updates

Tap **Check for Updates** to look for a newer release on your selected [update channel](#update-channels). If one is available, an update dialog walks you through installing it. You'll see the following stages:

1. **Update Available** — Shows the new version. Tap **Install** to begin, or **Cancel** to dismiss.
2. **Downloading...** — A progress bar tracks the download. You can still **Cancel** at this point. The dialog closes straight away, but the download itself keeps running quietly in the background until the current transfer finishes; the partly-downloaded file is then thrown away. If you start another update before that has happened, you'll get an **Update Failed** screen reading **"Previous download still finishing"** — wait a few seconds and tap **Retry**.
3. **Verifying...** — HelixScreen checks the downloaded file before installing.
4. **Installing...** — The new version is written into place. **Do not power off your printer** while this is in progress.
5. **Update installed!** — Confirmation that the new version is in place.
6. **Hang on, we'll be right back!** — HelixScreen restarts itself to run the new version.

Steps 5 and 6 are each shown only for a moment: the install is already finished by then, and the short pause exists so you can see that it succeeded before the app exits and comes back.

If something goes wrong, an **Update Failed** screen appears with a **Retry** button so you can try again, or **Close** to dismiss.

> **Caution:** Once installation begins, leave the printer powered on until HelixScreen restarts on its own. Interrupting an install can leave HelixScreen in an inconsistent state.

This row is hidden on Android, where updates are managed through the Play Store.

### Easter Eggs

- Tap the **Printer Name** row **seven times** to launch a hidden Snake game
- Tap the **Current Version** row **seven times** to toggle beta features — works like Android's "tap build number" developer mode

### Enabling Beta Features

Tap the **Current Version** row seven times in Settings → About to toggle beta features.

When beta features are enabled:
- **Update Channel** selector gains a third entry, **Dev**
- Additional items appear in the Advanced panel (Macro Browser, Timelapse, etc.)
- **Plugins** section appears in Settings
- Tap seven more times to disable

### Update Channels

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stable** | Recommended. Tested releases only. |
| **Beta** | Preview builds with new features. May have rough edges. |
| **Dev** | Development builds. Appears only with beta features enabled, and requires a `dev_url` configured under the `update` section of your config file. |

> **Note:** Selecting the **Dev** channel without a `dev_url` set in your configuration shows a "Dev channel requires dev_url in config" message and won't check for updates. Dev builds are intended for HelixScreen contributors — most users should stay on **Stable** or **Beta**.
