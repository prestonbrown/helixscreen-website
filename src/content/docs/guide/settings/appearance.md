The first section in the Settings panel covers visual preferences and display configuration.

---

## Language

Choose the display language for all UI text. Currently English is the only supported language; more translations are planned.

---

## Time Format

Choose between 12-hour and 24-hour clock display. Affects all timestamps shown throughout the UI.

---

## Animations

Toggle UI motion effects (transitions, panel slides, confetti). Disable for better performance on slower hardware like Raspberry Pi 3.

---

## G-code Preview

Enable interactive 3D G-code visualization during prints. When off, only the 2D layer view is available. Disable if your hardware struggles with 3D rendering.

---

## Display Settings

Tap **Display Settings** to open an overlay with detailed display options:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Dark Mode** | Switch between light and dark themes. Disabled when the active theme doesn't support both modes. |
| **Theme Colors** | Open the theme explorer to browse, preview, and apply color themes. |
| **Brightness** | Slider from 10–100%. Only shown on hardware with backlight control (hidden on Android). |
| **Bed Mesh Render** | Auto, 3D View, or 2D Heatmap visualization for bed mesh data. |
| **Screen Dim** | When the screen dims to lower brightness: Never, 30s, 1m, 2m, or 5m of inactivity. |
| **Display Sleep** | When the screen turns off completely: Never, 1m, 5m, 10m, or 30m of inactivity. |
| **Sleep While Printing** | Allow the display to sleep during active prints. Off by default so you can monitor progress. |

> **Tip:** Touch the screen to wake from sleep.

### Display Rotation

On first boot, HelixScreen automatically detects your display orientation. It cycles through rotation options — tap the screen when the text appears right-side up, then tap again to confirm. The setting is saved and touch coordinates adjust automatically.

To change rotation manually, edit `display.rotate` in `settings.json` (values: `0`, `90`, `180`, `270`) and restart HelixScreen. To re-run automatic detection, remove both `rotate` and `rotation_probed` from the `display` section and restart.

> **Note:** Rotation is not exposed in the Settings UI because it requires restarting all three binaries (main app, splash screen, watchdog).

### Layout Auto-Detection

HelixScreen automatically selects the best layout for your display size:

| Layout | Resolution | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Standard** | 800x480 | Most 7" touchscreens |
| **Ultrawide** | 1920x480 | Bar-style displays |
| **Compact** | 480x320 | Small 3.5" screens |

Override with the `--layout` command-line flag if auto-detection picks the wrong layout.

## Toolhead Style

Choose the toolhead icon shown on the Home Panel and Print Status screen. Options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Auto** (default) | HelixScreen detects your toolhead from the printer database or Klipper config |
| **Default** | Generic toolhead icon |
| **A4T** | Armored Turtle toolhead |
| **Anthead** | Anthead toolhead |
| **Jabberwocky** | Jabberwocky toolhead |
| **StealthBurner** | Voron StealthBurner toolhead |
| **Creality K1** | Creality K1 series toolhead |
| **Creality K2** | Creality K2 series toolhead |

Most users can leave this on **Auto**. Change it if HelixScreen picks the wrong icon or if you've swapped to an aftermarket toolhead.

## Home Widgets

Tap **Home Widgets** to configure which widgets appear on your Home Panel dashboard and in what order.

- **Toggle** individual widgets on or off (maximum 10 enabled) — changes appear on the Home Panel in real time as you flip each switch
- **Reorder** by long-pressing the drag handle on any row and dragging it up or down
- Widgets tied to specific hardware (AMS, humidity sensor, probe, etc.) show "(not detected)" and are disabled if that hardware isn't present

### Widget Details

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Power** | Toggle Moonraker power devices. Only appears if power devices are configured. |
| **Network** | WiFi signal strength or Ethernet status. Disabled by default. |
| **Firmware Restart** | Restart Klipper firmware with one tap. Always shown in SHUTDOWN state, even if disabled. Disabled by default. |
| **AMS Status** | Mini view of multi-material spool slots. Only appears if an AMS/MMU system is detected. |
| **Temperature** | Nozzle temperature with animated heating icon. Tap to open the Temperature panel. |
