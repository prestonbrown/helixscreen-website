HelixScreen can read Spoolman QR codes from a USB or Bluetooth barcode scanner, so you can identify a spool by scanning it instead of picking from a list.

This guide covers both USB and Bluetooth scanners, and how to fix the most common Bluetooth pairing problem on Raspberry Pi.

---

## USB Scanners

Most USB barcode scanners present themselves to the Pi as a plain HID keyboard — no driver install needed.

1. Plug the scanner into any USB port.
2. Open **Settings → Barcode Scanner**.
3. If the scanner appears under "USB devices", tap it to select. Otherwise "Auto-detect" will pick the first HID keyboard that isn't your physical keyboard.
4. Open the QR scanner overlay (wherever the app offers it — e.g. from the filament panel) and test by scanning a Spoolman QR code.

### Keymap

If scanned text comes out garbled, the scanner is emitting keycodes for a different keyboard layout than the one HelixScreen is decoding. Under **Settings → Barcode Scanner → Keymap** pick the layout your scanner is programmed to use (QWERTY is the default).

## Bluetooth Scanners

HelixScreen supports Bluetooth HID barcode scanners (the kind that pair as a keyboard-like device).

### Pairing

1. Power on the scanner. Make sure it's in Classic Bluetooth pairing mode (not BLE). The scanner's manual will have a config barcode to select Classic mode if needed — most default to Classic.
2. Open **Settings → Barcode Scanner → Scan Bluetooth**.
3. When your scanner appears in the dropdown, tap **Pair**.
4. If pairing succeeds, the scanner becomes selected automatically.

### ⚠️ "Paired, but scanner is not usable"

If you see a warning toast that says pairing worked but the scanner is not usable, your adapter is refusing the HID connection because the scanner didn't perform a **bonded** pair.

This is a security default in BlueZ: HID devices must be bonded (cryptographic key exchanged and stored) before the kernel will route their keystrokes. Many inexpensive barcode scanners only support "Just Works" pairing, which produces a paired-but-not-bonded link — and gets rejected.

#### Fix

Relax the HID-bonded-only policy on your Pi. You'll need SSH access.

1. SSH to the Pi:
   ```bash
   ssh pi@helixpi.local
   ```
2. Edit the BlueZ input config:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/input.conf
   ```
3. Find the line:
   ```
   #ClassicBondedOnly=true
   ```
   Uncomment it and change to:
   ```
   ClassicBondedOnly=false
   ```
4. Save and restart BlueZ:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
   ```
5. In HelixScreen, forget any previous pairing for this scanner, then pair again. You should not see the warning this time and scanning into the QR overlay will work.

> **Security note:** `ClassicBondedOnly=false` lets any unbonded HID peripheral connect, which slightly widens the attack surface for keystroke injection. This is only a concern in hostile RF environments. For typical home and workshop use, the change is safe.

### BLE Mode

Some scanners support both Classic and BLE modes. BLE uses different pairing mechanics that always bond, so the issue above doesn't apply — but not all scanners advertise reliably in BLE. If Classic works, stick with it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No scanner appears in the dropdown | Is Bluetooth enabled on your Pi? See [Bluetooth Setup](/docs/guide/bluetooth-setup/). |
| "Pairing failed" (Connection timed out) | Scanner isn't in pairable mode. Power-cycle it and scan its Classic-mode config barcode. |
| "Pairing failed" (Host is down) | Scanner is flashing but refusing Classic connections. Power-cycle and retry; some scanners get stuck between BLE and Classic advertising. |
| "Paired, but scanner is not usable" | Set `ClassicBondedOnly=false` — see above. |
| Scanner pairs, but scanned text types into the app's UI instead of being captured as a QR code | Open the QR scanner overlay before scanning. Outside the overlay, the scanner is just a keyboard. |
| Scanned text has wrong characters | Set the correct keymap under **Settings → Barcode Scanner**. |

## Notes

- Only one scanner (USB or Bluetooth) is used at a time. If both are configured, the paired Bluetooth scanner wins.
- When a Bluetooth scanner is selected, HelixScreen captures its keystrokes exclusively so they don't leak into other UI widgets. USB scanners run in passive mode (some scanners rely on this) — if USB scanner keystrokes leak into focused text inputs, that is a known limitation.
