## G-code Console
A full-featured G-code terminal for sending commands directly to your printer and viewing Klipper responses in real time.

**Opening the console:**

- Navigate to **Advanced > G-code Console**, or
- Add the **G-code Console** widget to your home panel for one-tap access

**Sending commands:**

1. Type a G-code command in the input field at the bottom (e.g., `G28`, `M104 S210`)
2. Press **Enter** on the keyboard or tap the **send button**
3. The command appears with a `>` prefix, and Klipper's response streams in below

**Command history:**

- Press **Up/Down arrow keys** to recall previously sent commands
- Up to 20 recent commands are remembered within the session

**Color coding:**

- **White**: Commands you sent (prefixed with `>`)
- **Green**: Successful responses from Klipper
- **Red**: Errors and warnings (lines starting with `!!` or `Error`)
- **Colored spans**: AFC and Happy Hare plugins send colored output that renders inline

**Other features:**

- **Auto-scroll**: The console scrolls to show new messages automatically. Scroll up to pause auto-scroll and read history — it resumes when you send a new command
- **Timestamps**: On medium and larger screens, each line shows an `HH:MM:SS` timestamp
- **Clear button**: Tap the trash icon to clear the display (with confirmation)
- **Monospace font**: Console text uses Source Code Pro for easier reading of G-code output
- Temperature status messages (`T:210.0 /210.0 B:60.0 /60.0`) are automatically filtered out to reduce noise

## Macro Execution

![Macro Panel](../../../assets/images/docs/advanced-macros.png)

Browse and execute all of your Klipper macros.

**Opening the Macros panel:**

- Navigate to **Advanced > Macros**, or
- Add the **Macros** widget to your home panel for one-tap access

**Browsing macros:**

1. All macros from your Klipper configuration are listed alphabetically
2. Names are prettified for readability: `CLEAN_NOZZLE` becomes "Clean Nozzle"
3. System macros (starting with `_`) are hidden by default — use the toggle to show them
4. Tap any macro to execute it

**Macro parameters:**

Some macros accept parameters (variables or arguments defined in your Klipper config). When you tap a macro that has parameters:

- A **parameter input form** appears showing each parameter with its default value
- Edit the values you want to change, then tap **Run** to execute
- Parameters are pre-detected when HelixScreen connects to your printer, so there's no loading delay

If HelixScreen can't determine the parameters (e.g., complex Jinja2 templates), a freeform text field lets you type raw parameters.

**Dangerous macro protection:**

These macros show a confirmation dialog before executing:

- `SAVE_CONFIG` — writes configuration changes to disk
- `FIRMWARE_RESTART` / `RESTART` — restarts Klipper
- `SHUTDOWN` — shuts down the printer host
- `M112` / `EMERGENCY_STOP` — emergency stop

## Probe Management

View and control your Z probe. HelixScreen auto-detects your probe type (Cartographer, Beacon, BLTouch, BTT Eddy, Mellow Fly Eddy, Voron Tap, Klicky, or standard probe) and shows type-specific controls.

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Probe Management** (only visible when a probe is detected)
2. View probe type, Z-offset, and sensor readings (coil temperature for Cartographer, sensor temperature for Beacon)
3. Use type-specific buttons (Calibrate, Touch Cal, Scan Cal, Auto-Cal, Deploy/Dock, etc.)
4. Access universal actions: Accuracy Test, Z-Offset Calibration, Bed Mesh
5. Edit probe configuration values (offsets, samples, speed, tolerance)

For full details, see [Calibration & Tuning — Probe Management](calibration.md#probe-management).

## Power Device Control

Control Moonraker power devices from the full power panel or the home panel quick-toggle button.

### Home Panel Quick Toggle

A **power-cycle button** appears on the home panel when power devices are configured:

- **Tap** to toggle your selected power devices on or off
- **Long-press** to open the full power panel overlay
- The button shows a **danger (red) variant** when devices are on, and **muted** when off

### Full Power Panel

1. Navigate to **Advanced > Power Devices**, or **Settings > System > Power Devices** (hidden when no power devices are detected)
2. Toggle individual devices on/off with switches

**Main Power Button section:**

At the top of the power panel, a **"Main Power Button"** section lets you choose which devices the home panel quick-toggle controls:

- Selection chips appear for each discovered power device
- Tap chips to include or exclude devices from the home button
- Your selection is saved automatically

### Auto-Discovery

HelixScreen automatically discovers power devices from Moonraker when it connects to your printer. On first discovery, all devices are selected for the home panel button by default. The **Power Devices** row in the Advanced panel is hidden when no power devices are available.

**Notes:**

- Devices may be locked during prints (safety feature)
- Lock icon indicates protected devices

## Timelapse

Record timelapse videos of your prints automatically using the [moonraker-timelapse](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/moonraker-timelapse) plugin.

### Setup

If the timelapse plugin is not installed, HelixScreen detects this and offers a guided **Install Wizard**:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Timelapse Setup**
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the plugin via SSH
3. HelixScreen will configure your `moonraker.conf` automatically
4. After installation, the setup row is replaced by timelapse settings and video browser

### Settings

Navigate to **Settings > Timelapse** to configure:

- **Enable/disable** timelapse recording
- **Recording mode**: Layer Macro (snapshot at each layer) or Hyperlapse (time-based)
- **Framerate**: 15, 24, 30, or 60 fps
- **Auto-render**: Automatically create videos when prints finish

A quick **toggle button** also appears on the print status panel to enable/disable timelapse without leaving the print view.

### Video Browser

Navigate to **Settings > Timelapse Videos** to browse your recorded timelapses:

- **Thumbnail grid** with responsive card sizing that adapts to your screen
- Each card shows a **video thumbnail**, filename, file size, and date
- **Tap** a card to play the video fullscreen (requires mpv or ffplay on your device)
- **Long-press** a card to delete it (with confirmation)
- Videos are stored on your printer and managed by the timelapse plugin

### Rendering

When frames have been captured during a print, a **render section** appears above the video grid:

- Shows the number of captured frames, print filename, and capture date
- A **progress bar** appears during rendering with status text
- Tap **Render Now** to manually create a video from captured frames
- When rendering completes, the video list refreshes automatically to show the new video
- A toast notification appears at the start and end of rendering

### Notifications

| Event | Notification |
|-------|-------------|
| Rendering starts | "Rendering timelapse..." |
| Rendering completes | "Timelapse rendered successfully" |
| Rendering fails | "Timelapse render failed" with error details |
